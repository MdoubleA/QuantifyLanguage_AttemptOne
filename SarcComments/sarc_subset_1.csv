1	I worked as an aid for an after school program where I helped take care of 2-to-6 year olds almost every afternoon. One thing I continuously taught them was how they should try to poop as LITTLE as possible. It's better that they poop one big poop in a 48 hour period, than poop 4 small poops in 48 hours. I taught them to hold it in - why? Because simply put, pooping is DISGUSTING! It SMELLS bad, it LOOKS bad, and it SHOULD make you feel ashamed of yourself! It derides you morally, it's a most indecorous behavior. Now unfortunately we all need to poop, but it's best we do this act as little as possible throughout our lives. I would strongly suggest to anyone - ESPECIALLY children - not to poop more than 120 times a year. My personal goal was 97 poops in a year and I did it in 2005. I will continue to work with children and share with them the embarrassments of pooping - this should be even more understood by girls. No fairy tale prince wants to run off with a princess who poops - where's THAT children's book?!	abillionistoomany	WTF	-1	-1	0	2009-04	1240478497	"""I almost NEVER poop, pooping is DISGUSTING"""	c091u4l	8epf4

Except they have to go back in time to the 80s, where there are tons of better jokes to use than the lame 70s stuff this guy came up with. For example, you could set up Marty's parents as a knowing parody of a John Hughes movie: his Mom's dressing up like Molly Ringwald and his Dad's a pathetic loser spouting Ferris Bueller quotes. You could get in winks at all the great 80s teen movies from The Breakfast Club on down. The original Marty McFly laughed at his parents antiquated television set, but imagine a modern teen with no google and no cell phone. Replace the Reagan joke with a riff on the Terminatuh being the current governor of California and you're pretty much set. Marty's supposed to be a teen in high school which means he was born in the 90s -- so the time frame works too.	c09y2ev	8oixq

In fact colleges and the entire American school system is solely based on compulsory attendence, regergatation of facts, and memorization instead of being based on actual learning.  Anything outside of the course material is deemed unnesary and often times innapropriate.  Furthermore, schools do not teach kids the primary skills neccesary to be ready for their chosen profession. Of course there is the rare example of certain specialized fields but even then, the universities want kids to just accept certain opinions on how it is properly done instead of trying to advance a certain field or look for ways to improve on certain methods.  It is without a doubt a subtle method of control for the state, a way to neautrilize the general population towards popular beliefs.  In fact seeking other methods is just considered lunacy.

I was jogging on S. Congress and stopped to a walks pace before I see someone who I thought closely resembled him sitting in a booth at the window in the S. Congress Cafe (Across the street is a church that was in a scene in Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof). So I kept walking only to think I had run far enough, and when I started walking back towards the Cafe. At that moment, the door opened and him, Michelle Williams, and some other man came walking out and we began walking in stride all together. I had seen The Patriot twice, and Brokeback Mountain all in the theaters,  so at this point I knew who he was, and just stared at him. He kept his eyes on the ground, and only after it was obvious I was probably literally starstruck and surprised, he said, while pulling his long hair out of his face, ""Hey Man, what's up?""  I look at Michelle Williams whos eyes are wide and smiling at me, and then I look back at Heath and say ""YOU'RE GONNA KICK ASS AS THE JOKER"", and Michelle Williams and the other man laughed. At that point, I didn't want too appear bothersome so I ran off to continue my run. My impressions were that he was grungy, with tattoos on his forearm, but a handsome man. A story I will never forget, and loved to share with you all."	c0jhs7b	auimc

I'm just surprised a hired merc hasn't come out with a .50 Berrett Rifle on one of those ships and put a few holes in the Steve Irwin along the water line.

I am better than people who continue to pay for content via a standard delivery service in every way. In fact, I'm so cool that I don't even watch the content that I do download. I read books instead, but I don't pay for them. I tore up my library card because I can get all of that content via my kindle and iPad now and read it in bed with my cat. Oh yeah I also got rid of my cat too. I have an iPad now so I can download pictures of cats for free and since my iPad screen is so big I can pet it and don't have to worry about feeding it either.

I am prepared for downvotes because the truth hurts. The Civil War was not fought to abolish slavery. Although it was a great occurrence because of the Civil War, it really didn't have much weight in the decision process of going to war. Slaves were owned by rich plantation owners, and the majority of people who fought for the South were poor farmers. The main reason the Civil War was fought was because of State's rights. The South feared a strong centralized Federal Government. The North wanted less State rights and more centralized government. It is thought that slavery would've been phased out naturally due to economic reasons than for legal reasons. Slaves were expensive; you had to feed, cloth, and house people year round. At this time seasonal workers were becoming more common. By the time of the Civil War, slaves were a status symbol for the rich. I am TOTALLY FOR the abolishment of slavery. I think slavery in any form is disgusting and has no place in any civilization, but we need to get our facts straight here.	c0nbog2	bl7ln

1	The kids reconciliation with their father is gone. They missed that opportunity when he died. Now they are just trying to re conciliate with their fathers money. How loving.	bigpappa	AskReddit	6	6	0	2010-05	1273618097	I agree with newsedition. OP is a different person with a different life to live, and has to make choices based on this. What is his relationship to these nieces/nephews? What kind of relationship does he want with these nieces/nephews? Was the dead brother not on speaking terms with his kids because that's what the kids truly wanted, and if they did want that, was it because they were teens/young adults when the relationship broke down? My father, influenced by his crazy wife (not my mother), cut me and one of my brothers out of his life for nearly 10 years. We weren't on speaking terms but that was because he wouldn't respond to our efforts at reconciliation. And in fact, my dad's brother took sides with my dad in a situation in which he had only my dad's version of the story. I didn't blame my uncle for his loyalty but I did see him as completely out of line in his conclusions and behavior. My dad's wife eventually died and my dad eventually got back in touch and is now loving and supportive. But it took TEN YEARS for him to come around, and the illness and eventual suicide of his wife, and a lot of maturing in his soul. And he had to be in control of the timing and the process when it did happen. I spent my 20s without my father. For some of the time, I was angry as hell at him: most of all for thinking he could sever a relationship that HE had created (when he was young and married to my mother). Then I got over it and I spent five years wishing only that we would reconcile before he died. I did NOT want him to die in such a state of internal strife and turmoil. I desperately wanted him to die knowing how much I loved and honored him, how sorry I was for what I had done to contribute to the chasm, and that he was forgiven entirely. I am so eternally grateful that we reconciled in fact, in time for him to be at my son's birth. I think this long view is necessary for the OP. These situations in families are rarely static. It is probable that eventually the brother and his children would have reconciled, had the brother lived longer. And I also think that it's very important to realize that the brother could not have been entirely innocent in whatever went wrong in these relationships. Regardless of the wife who cheated and turned the kids against him. It's impossible for anyone to be innocent in these situations. And a man who is that successful probably, along the way, sacrificed some things related to his kids' needs, and later reacted immaturely to whatever they did that upset him. So, really, the OP needs to think more deeply about his brother, and his brother's values, and come to a conclusion that IS about those kids' own reconciliation with their father.	c0ptc6o	c2lgk

What I did was measure the dimensions of my room along with the bathroom and the pathway I took from my room to the front door.

We've virtually eliminated our drug market with just 70 years of government thugs locking millions of people into cages.  We have the smallest drug market in the world now.  It made the drug dealers more peaceful toward the end there too.  They'd sell off their guns proportionately with the increase in the use of militaristic police force.

1	please.  you're trying to bring logic into the conversation?  this is reddit!  this is America!  we all deserve a high standard of living don't we?!  isn't that in the Constitution or something?  how can those greedy evil bastard republicans/corporations turn a blind eye to the poor people in desperate need for just an aspirin or two?  so what if they smoked, drank and overate for 40 years, they deserve millions of dollars of hospital treatment because they are human too!  aren't all men created equal?  that means we should all get free healthcare!  I don't see why the greatest country in the history of the earth can't afford it!  I mean if Cuba can give free healthcare to all its citizens why can't America?  Can't doctors be happy making $100,000 a year?  Isn't that enough?  That's what they get in England and they are very happy with it!  If we could just get everyone together to pool our money and pay for everyone, that itself would bring down all the costs right?  Isn't that how it works in economics?  I've never taken an economics class but that's what I read on Huffpo so it must be true.  Yeah we'll all be okay as long as the Democrats are in charge.  I trust them because they aren't hypocrites like those secretly gay conservatives who are always raving about God or something.	salstress	politics	0	0	0	2010-09	1283348484	Can someone explain where the concept of affordable healthcare as a right is rooted.
