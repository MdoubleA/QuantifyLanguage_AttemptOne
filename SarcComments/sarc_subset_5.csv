JCelsius	atheism	1	1	0	2012-01	1326674175	Misinterpretation of Dr. Paul's philosophy for the loss. Giving states the power to essentially do what they want, while remaining in the confines of the constitution does not mean that religious people are gonna take over the country. In fact, it means the opposite, preventing them from taking over the Federal government. What's great about states is you can vote with your feet, similar to laissez-faire economics. Don't like Christian politics? Move to California and let the Christians have as much freedom as you do.	c3hk541	oi7au

Because Christie actually stuck to his beliefs. He didn't flop for public opinion, or to continue to re-elect. He stood by what he felt was right, even if I or others of us don't feel it is. Plus, if citizens of NJ approve it and send it to him, telling him ""this is what we want"" if he says no then that's when I would have a big problem. One of his major duties is to serve the people, and if the people overall say ""yes"" then give them what they want.

1	Why not remove the word marriage from any state sanctioned union while we're at it? If the word marriage is what bugs people, then let's leave it in the churches. In any event, matrimony derives from the concept of being a mother and I don't think the word should be used if people aren't going to have children when they're married. It ruins the sanctity of the word and the institution.	onewoodee	atheism	3	3	0	2012-02	1329082781	"I agree. Let gays join together in a partnership and even raise children if they want. But don't call it marriage. Because that is not what it is. If it just meant a union between people, then why does it have to specifically be referred to as ""same-sex"" marriage. Partnership was what homosexual people used in the beginning and to me it sounds better. I'll let them have their right, but let me keep my word. Seems like a fair trade off to me unless you are really that stubborn or just fighting over semantics rather then the actual rights."	c3qj757	pm27u

This business does not allow women with children to work at their company as women should be at home raising their children.  They fired her when they found out she was pregnant, which of course caused her to lose the insurance she had with the company, and when you're pregnant, that's a pre-existing condition so it's impossible to get insurance again.  Luckily she was able to get on her husband's insurance, but the fact that this company did this to her pisses me off to no extent.	c46se8k	rkuk1

Come to MP and see. You will find people who don't have enough to travel. They are not going on a holiday. They go out to search for jobs. And if you start charging them more so that AC can be provided in all trains, that is just wrong. I don't mind that AC fares have been increased. But other fares should not be increased. WE should think about social welfare also. The buses are already costly. With diesel hike, trucks are also costly. They are also unsafe. What is the alternative for a person to travel to city to earn a livelihood. Not all of India live in cities.

It's a mix between that, and allowing people to say whatever they want just because I don't want to fight.  I'm finding a balance.  It can be hard in Texas, there is still a lot of rampant racism and homophobia.  I'm a straight white girl, so most people feel like they can say anything to me and I won't care, but I have a mixed family and a gay best friend so I do care.	c3zgcex	qp0h5

1	Yeah, and rising sea level has no impact at all on the islands capacity to hold fresh rainwater.	JRugman	climateskeptics	0	0	0	2012-03	1331254998	The problem with freshwater in these islands is that it is floats on salt water, is replenished by rainfall and is a limited commodity. Once the freshwater lens is depleted the water is gone. Most Islands of this nature that have populations are dependent on rainfall for their fresh water needs. On bigger Islands you see streams but atolls are typically much smaller. This lack of freshwater is not due to encroaching saltwater, but depletion of the existing freshwater from over use.	c3z3oh6	qna6q

Then, people can exchange these receipts for goods and services.	lex418787	Libertarian	1	1	0	2012-03	1331162633	Tungsten can cost as little as $25/kilo based on a quick google, a far cry from the $1500+/oz of gold.  The pros who are dealing in bars of bouillon might drill but that is impractical for regular trading and use as money.  you can't drill into every coin you get and if you did, the weight of the coin would be less each time someone did it.  You might say that once the coin is drilled once, it is prof that it was tested and genuine, but then I would start making tungsten coins with holes drilled in them and then plate those in gold.	c3yq4dq	qkxmi
