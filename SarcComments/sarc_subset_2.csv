1	...but your headstone will say that you were innocent. It's not all bad news.	sge_fan	politics	1	1	0	2010-10	1286991940	There is the rub, one is not allowed to defend ones self from police, even if the force is excessive, even if the person is in fear of their life. The repercussions in court would be (depending on the state of course) capital murder, most likely with a death sentence. The law views the law enforcement officer as infalble and any effort to resist is obstruction of justice, resisting arrest or any other of numerous violations. The court's view is that you should obey and then work out what ever injustices are visted upon you in the court system. This discourages police from using common sense and good judgment when they can just foist that responsibility on someone else. Conversely, if everyone used the excuse that they were only defending themselves from unjust assault, it would be easy to kill a cop for just doing his job, and get away with it.

Yes, I know the mocked Keynesian response to any insufficient recovery is that you didn't stimulate enough.  However, in this case, it's true.  Of the 850 billion stimulus, roughly 1/3 went to states to shore up their budgets.  This didn't increase any government spending at all, it just allowed the states to not make quite as many cuts as they might have otherwise.  Another 1/3 went into tax cuts, and the last 1/3 went into infrastructure projects, leaving the actual ""stimulative"" spending at closer to 500 billion.  In spite of the stimulus funding, states and municipalities have been cutting their spending left and right and increasing taxes to a degree that effectively offsets the rest of the federal stimulus.  Thus overall government spending wasn't really increased by any significant margin - the stimulus merely made the spending shift from the states and municipalities to the federal government."	c154uts	e40kk

Embraers (depending on on the carrier's individual build options) are particularly tail heavy:  larger aircraft can also have issues depending on anything from overfuelling (aircraft change after fuelled for different destination, pilots that don't trust dispatchers flight plan and bump up the fuel which then exceeds safe takeoff weights meaning passengers off) to balance issues where there is more/less baggage(or cargo) than what is needed to keep the plane in balance ( A321 with spare fuel tank needs significant weight in the aft to keep it in trim). Of course I'm not going into where there can be weather/mechanical issues that place further restrictions on a particular flight/aircraft type/route. If we are over legal weight by 1 kg we still have to remove that weight from the aircraft as silly as that may seem... the systems and regulations do not allow us to excede defined maximums - so clearly they ""busted"" that weight limit at the last minute. Taking passengers off was the fastest mitigation of the issue (as the alternative is removing baggage). TL - overbooking not the issue - weight issue was real."	c1aqm8r	et3pf

I am, in all likelihood, more *qualified* to critique these sort of proposals (not just because I do a course, but because I spend an immense amount of time in political observation in addition to it) but I fear doing so, because one thing I've observed about most with respect to individuals in a democracy is their lack of a holistic approach to the very topic of politics (not that anyone aside from a God is even capable of approaching it that way). This is my simple way of saying: That's the thing with politics, you can't nitpick factors and assume that that's that. The amount of knowledge each and every single one of us lack is so immense that I don't understand how some people can be so certain with their political arguments and proposals. The case I'm pushing forward for here is really more ontological, rather than political. It's pretty axiomatic, so there isn't much to argue about.	c18vtxv	eknjo

Started using CDJs and a shitty mixer around one year ago when I decided I wanted to start DJing. I learned how to DJ with Ableton in the summer, but haven't used it yet during a live set due to the fact that I don't want to buy an official version (pirated versions crash at random times). My best friend DJs with Ableton and an APC40 and he can throw a mean set. I like my CDJs though. Something about beat matching in the mix appeals to me.	c184eso	eh677

Of course we were young, most were around 17, so we hadn't had time to put on much weight yet, but yes, we all went back with the stereotype reinforced.	c1caxxx	f0691

The difference here is that the teacher does not have any risk to take or money to lose in their business. There is no way the teacher is going to owe the school $50,000 for any reason.

1	So St. Augustine is saying that pre-Christian people knew exactly how the story of Christ would go down.  Instead of being content with knowing it would happen eventually, they went ahead and came up with their own gods to complete the story, which is why the stories are so similar. That seems so much more logical than Christians taking them from existing mythologies.	toSpiteMyFace	DebateAChristian	8	8	0	2011-02	1297288183	"St Augustine (Augustini Opera, 1, 12) - ""The very thing which is now called the Christian religion, really was known to the ancients, nor was it wanting at any time from the beginning of the human race up to the time Christ came in the flesh; from which time the true religion, which has previously existed, began to be called Christian, and this in our days is the Christian religion, not as having been wanting in former times, but as having in later times received that name."""	c1g4x53	fi9yz

1	While we're at it, why don't we just make it so that the poor and rich pay taxes with a flat annual payment, or we can just make it so that people pay for government services based on use since surely rich people use those services less and there's no justification for people paying more because of their personal values of hard work, dedication and ingenuity that lead to their wealth.	AnotherBlackMan	AskReddit	3	3	0	2011-03	1300659704	Sure so how about we limit govt in a fashion so it can operate on what only the poor can provide.  If the poor can provide 5% of income (lower than they give now) and we also put rich people at that 5% then the rich do pay more but it is still equal.

And They have not made a single move yet! they entered the country because of the riots actions towards the some schools and some hospitals and to clear the country's main roads that the protestors were settling in, so people can go to their jobs and homes. King has granted every single request by the Shiite party. He had replaced 4 Sunni ministers with 4 Shiite ministers. There is no prejudice in any kind of way in the country between the two party. The shiite has took advantage of what has happened in Tunisia and Egypt so they jumped on the wagon, where there is no similarities. The Khalifa family has ruled the country long time before the Shiite have outnumbered the Sunnis. Now that they are 70% of the population does not give them any right to go and destroy the country's properties, inflame hatred between the two parties. The Khalifa family asked them several times to sit down and negotiate and they reply chanting death to the Khalifa. So the Khalifa asked their neighbors for help. BAHRAIN IS NOT AN EXAMPLE OF A SUPPORTED DICTATORSHIP BY THE US! This is only a majority of Shiia trying to rule a minority of Sunna by any means.	c1kz0jk	g50zm

I can agree with you I would hate to see the guns be  laser accurate like CoD. I have to say The Core battlefield series (not bad company) has done a fantastic job at creating proper weapon deviation and recoil, the trailer for bf3 shows they seem to be on the right track.

1	b, bu, bu, bu but BOTH PARITIES SAME! OBAMA BAD! DOWNVOTED!!1	robotevil	politics	2	2	0	2011-04	1302936367	Could you please document what you mean by acting like a Republican Scumbag?  Seems to me he's pulled us out of a recession, made the biggest reform of health care in decades, appointed two fairly liberal female judges to the supreme court, and pushed economic reforms, environmental reforms, promoted education, adopted a more diplomatic stance with the world, got rid of DADT in the military, etc.  I mean, if you look at a list of his accomplishments, especially a lot of the little ones that people miss, the guy has been BUSY.  I know he hasn't walked on water, or closed down Guantanamo, but to say he's acting like a Republican scumbag?  Seems a bit harsh.	c1pozuz	gquq0

1	No, in the article they *guessed* that she was running a ponzi scheme, because who could possibly promise 80% ROI, right?	i4ybrid	worldnews	1	1	0	2011-04	1302926728	I heard this is also common among Arabs. Its basically a system of lending without interest based on a trusted circle within their community. But, in the article it mentions she was borrowing w/ the promise of 80% returns and lending at an even higher rate. This tells me that she is not borrowing from the system you mentioned, unless the Chinese version has interest attached. It also says she is able to lend at an even higher rate which tells me that there's much more to the story. I'd guess the story in the news is only tangentially related to the real reason she's been sentenced to death.	c1pof29	gqup7

Deusdies	worldnews	2	2	0	2011-04	1302922691	"Croatia was not their country nor it is today. They have a country - Serbia. I understand that there were some serbs that were pro Croatia and did not want to have anything to do with Serbia when the war started but, you have to realize that after Vukovar anything serbian was undesirable. After the war ended everybody attacked Croatia as if we were the aggressors asking questions like ""why did they, why did you, how could you"" and that really pisses me off. Where was UN, where was EU, where was USA etc. I think what happened today was that our own goverment sold us so we can go to EU. We've already been there, it was called YU=Yugoslavia and it DIDN'T WORK nor will EU for long. I don't want to comment on the war itself anymore 'cause you think you know everything I think I know everything, you believe in something I believe in something else.

1	It's like I've been saying since this story broke. Those CEO's deserved those bonuses, not a single CEO was killed or even hurt in the last year. In fact during that nasty bit of oil spill they received massages and other stress relievers so they wouldn't be harmed by the residual effects of anxiety. It's amazing how you small minded people seem to think that safety should include everyone in the company. I mean really, those companies are huge and employ large numbers of people. You can't really expect everyone, especially those guys working on those floating explosions out in the Gulf, to remain completely safe year round. Plus even if they wanted to now, they couldn't ask for that money back. Its been given as per their contract and they could sue the company for 10 times the amount if we asked for it back. Do you even know how contracts work? Basically they say that the CEO's get incentives bonuses for any random thing they choose and there's nothing you can do about it.	zarisin	worldnews	5	5	0	2011-04	1302020500	"Transocean acknowledged that its description of 2010 as its ""best year in safety"" despite a blowout that sank one of its rigs, killing 11 workers and causing a huge oil spill, might be insensitive."	c1nwulk	gj1qm
