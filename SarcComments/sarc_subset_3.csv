I do this in business all the time to make sure our male clients know that my female biz partner is part of the program.

This is just as offensive as somebody telling me I need to be ""saved"" and I won't want to hold hands with her anymore. Smokers can smoke and still be conscientious about their actions (i.e. blowing smoke away from other people), but if an LGBT person wants to even *exist*, it kills you a little inside to hear people say that they support who you are, just not your actions.

Its so much money, they could distribute that 7% to the people as social security starting at age 35, and everyone could retire early.  That's pretty much the opposite of what we have: we might have to take away from retirement, so we can pay interest (and pay for our war hobby).	c224kxa	i89m6

I highly recommend going to the TSA website and reading the guidelines for those with disabilities. Every detail is clearly documented, but there are so many different types of disabilities, it's easy to get scared. In my case, I cannot go through a metal detector due to metal implants, wear a back brace, and have balance issues that can make a standing TSA search difficult. Traveling with a disability can be daunting, especially when some TSA associates are ill-trained on rules pertaining to travelers with special needs. However, if you know what can and cannot be done, are polite, and gently remind those you may encounter during your search of your rights, flying can still be a positive experience. Yes, some TSA employees have bad attitudes and can be insensitive. Take notes. Report them. But know your rights and talk about the facts when asked to do something (or not do something) and avoid getting emotional. It makes the situation worse. I'm not saying that my experiences are 100% positive. In fact, I've encountered issues every single time I fly. For example, when I alert TSA agents to the fact that I have a metal implant, cannot go through a metal detector, and am wearing a back brace, I'm often told ""take off your brace and we won't have to do a pat down."" Each and every time, I simply reply ""I am unable to remove this brace."" The TSA actually cannot ask me to remove it and I'm often told that agents suggest that so I ""won't have to have a pat down."" There is a lengthy section on the TSA website of how the screening process works when you are in a situation similar to mine. Does the extra time in security bug me? Yes. However, knowing that my attitude and actions can change an annoying situation to a hostile confrontation with possibly legal implications, I chose to learn my rights and use them politely."	c21ykee	i95wd

Its the prime example of the saying ""When all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail"". When your most highly funded area is the defense budget then the key to solving drugs and terrorism appears to be forcible regime changes and police state tactics. Apart from still having the death penalty the US's stance on drugs is the most primitive and backwards part of its justice system. Ridiculously harsh sentencing due to mandatory minimums, a system that targets minorities and a failure to distinguish between harmful drugs and marijuana are just some of the most fundamental issues. Not only has the global war on drugs failed, it has made things much worse than if we had done nothing at all."	c1xkab3	hpuvm

1	I'm surprised this scared so many people. I've had folks jiggle my door knob before. Hell, I've even walked out of my house at 3 am to find two guys sitting on my stoop chatting. Even had a few guys come into my house at night and when I confronted them, they said they were drunk and in the wrong house. People are good at heart, you just have to give them a chance to show it. To assume everyone is out to get you, well, that's no way to live, my son.	Ospagett	fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu	-1	-1	0	2011-07	1309820072	Scariest Moment Of My Life	c23m00m	igmno

1	TRANSFER OF WEALTH! SOCIALISM	masterdanvk	politics	0	0	0	2011-08	1313391635	Here's an idea. Let's forget about raising total tax revenues for now. Let's slash the taxes of the poor and middle-class to jumpstart the economy. How about a 2-3 year payroll tax holiday and a 5% income tax cut? We can pay for it by increasing the rates for the wealthy to offset it. No revenue increases. Zero. $0 The government still has to deal with its debt and deficit problem with an increased possibility that the economy will start recovering at a faster pace generating more tax revenue at the same rates which will also begin to close the deficit. Suddenly when the poor and middle-class have some extra cash the so-called job creators will now have a reason to spend their trillions to fill the demand which will also require them to start hiring. When unemployment gets low enough they will need to start increasing wages again to compete for better workers. It's just crazy enough to work.	c2cjwe4	jj08v

1	Just the same as the officers who enforced the Jim Crow laws. They were just enforcing the laws on their books. They are not morally responsible for enforcing the laws even if the laws are immoral or unjust.   Just like we don't hold officers of less respected nations from enforcing the unjust laws of their society.  One European country used to have laws against harboring Jews.  I wouldn't expect an officer to act any other way but to enforce the law when he saw someone trying to hide a Jew in his residence. Thus we shouldn't fault such officers for doing so.	aijoe	politics	2	2	0	2011-09	1317265625	If you don't want this to happen, either change the eavesdropping law or make an exception for police officers on duty.  Enforcing the law is what police officers are there for - if a man is recording someone without their consent and there is a law *expressly forbidding it*, then I would not expect the officer to act any other way.  Indeed, anything else would represent a breach of the law itself, something we should minimize when possible.	c2negqq	kumgg
