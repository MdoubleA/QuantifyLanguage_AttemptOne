The gas was probably just a trigger slip and seconds later, the other projectile thrown at the protesters trying to reach the injured marine must not have not actually been thrown, just fell off of one of their tactical belts and defied the laws of physics to magically fall more than ten feet away at the exact moment the protesters were trying to help him	thatinternetzdude	politics	3	3	0	2011-10	1319907390	I never said that.  Open your fucking eyes man and tamper the bullshit bias.  I said I don't fucking know if it was or it wasn't.  I do know there is NO video showing someone with a weapon placed against their shoulder in a firing position.  From the wound, where he was at, where the crowd was and where the officers were, it looks like it may have been fired from the hip.  But, like a reasonable person, I ADMIT that I do NOT know and am open to ALL reasonable possibilities.  Unlike you who are blinded by their own bias.	c2vfhg1	lt7bm

Yes, it is my choice to attend a private institution and I will be paying off my debt until I die but attending another university to lessen your debt doesn't mean you get rid of student debt- which is the bigger picture. Student debt has beat out credit card debt, we're seeing in reduction in subsized government loads and the pell grant, and you can forget about TAP. So, the big thing with #OccupyRIT is: What can RIT do to help reduce student debt while still being reasonable? For starters, they can push for monetary endowments instead of gift 'endowments'- especially considering that gifts come with a maintenance price tag. Hopefully with monetary gifts they can do small scale beautifications and use the other portion to increase scholarship and financial aid.	c2u3xmu	lelvt

The children the op **chose to adopt** were not bad kids. They were kids with severe issues that needed help and proper care. They were neglected in that.

1	Why not just drown my face in stem cells, it might be cheaper.	sicinfit	AskReddit	0	0	0	2011-11	1322266275	Egg white masks help tighten skin, cucumbers on your skin soften it. Honey and sugar makes a great facial scrub. Toothpaste and tea tree oil applied to pimples will dry them out. Rub a dryer sheet over your hair to tame fuzzies and make it smell good. Baby power (a little) in your hair will remove grease. Rub toothpaste and lemon juice on yellow nails. Egg yolks and olive oil make a good cleanser for your hair. Nail polish dries faster if you dunk your hands under cold water (for real). Rust on your shaving bottles? Coat them with clear nail polish. Before dying hair or painting nails, put vaseline around your hairline and nails; easy wipe off afterwards. Tums can also act as a toliet bowl cleaner!	c32r8er	mouv5

Haven't you noticed all the little papers and leaves blowing around? Each one of those assets has physics applied and is being calculated by your GPU. Doesn't sound like much right? Well multiply it a few times and it starts to become expensive. If you can get an older card throw it in your system and dedicate it to just physx this will lighten the load.

Why is that?  You responded to everything else she said, but simply glossed over this one point time and time again, saying no matter what a man should have to shoulder his share of the burden.

""bone is 5 times stronger than steel."" This is only true for the weakest form of steel, AND when you are judging hardness based on a hardness to density scale. If you are comparing sheer hardness (which im sure they are) then bone is 1/4 as strong as the weakest form of steel. if it was 5 times as strong as the same type it would be nearly as hard as diamond.

So what then is the criteria for saying a game (or anything, for that matter) is good or bad? For instance, I don't know shit about art... and I might like a certain painting that has received poor critical reviews, but my asserting that I like it does not weigh in favor of the painting being a good painting... if anything, it probably says the opposite (because I don't know shit about art).	c3ctbws	nxnwy

Their wealth, in essence, grants them too much power. So, instead of enforcing laws against illegal behavior, instead of being on the watch for corrupt politicians, we are just going to limit the amount of income a person may earn?

I met him twice, both times he managed to almost hurt my daughter. First he thought she would like orange juice spilled on her face. AFTER he was told no orange juice 50x. Grabbed it out of the frigde and bolted to her and dumped it. A stern talking to for that. Second time he took her in her swing and pushed it to go super fast and knocked it over. A five minute time-out and then tried to do it again. He wanted some of her toys, and when I said no, he cried and screamed a fit. His mother said no to him to and he kept screaming and kicking her.

1	You obviously didn't pray hard enough.	WoollyMittens	AskReddit	1	1	0	2011-12	1324245988	I was a healthy young person.  Worked hard to keep myself healthy, minimum 1 hour exercise per day, often more.  Lead a very active lifestyle, ate healthy.  One day, at age 20, I got diagnosed with testicular cancer.  Nothing that I could have done to prevent it.  Even now there is no knowledge of what actually causes testicular cancer.  There are risk factors (of which i had none), sure, but no actual cause.  I was an unlucky casualty of statistics.  Thanks to my mother having fantastic healthcare, my family could easily afford the first half of my treatment.  Unfortunately, halfway through my treatment, my mother's employer changed their provider.  All the sudden, my oncologist and infusion clinic were out of network.  At the time I was lucky enough to have one of the best testicular cancer oncologist in the south east and was a hospital in my home town.  I would have had to find a new oncologist and a new infusion center (thanks to some very fierce fighting and LOTS of phone calls this was avoided).  The time to do that might have rendered my treatment ineffective.  The only person who was really qualified to handle testicular cancer cases where the first treatment option did not work was my current oncologist.  Despite all this hassle, I survived.  The point of that story is, it should not have had to happen.  People talk about death panels rationed health care, well guess what, i lived it in our private system.  Also, like you, i was a healthy young man, i got unlucky.  You could also, a tragic car wreck, get hit by a drunk driver, slip and fall in the super market, get cancer.  You are one unlucky moment away from that pooled cost effecting you to the positive.	c396jt1	nhaqd

1	Yeah, all of FOUR passes by Drew Brees were incomplete.  Ridiculous.	onebadace	nfl	1	1	0	2012-01	1327915372	They really underused Forte. Maybe it was the not having a contract and playing it safe. He can catch better than most of our receivers they could have used him in a screen or short plays but at that time all Brees cared about was airing it out most of which were incomplete when Forte was open 6 yards down with room to run. He would have been much more effective later in the game. Anyway I am more convinced now that they need to change to a skill competition instead.	c3m16yn	p2h91

1	Exactly.  Yet it is a global standard that to earn a degree you MUST pay bocoup dollars (well, someone pays the money whether it be the tax payers, or yourself, depending on your country), and attend classes, and take several tests.... I completely agree with you on the function and purpose of attending classes, but this is a de-facto requirement... It is very difficult for someone to get a 'higher learning' institution to allow you to just prove your proficiency and receive a fully accredited degree.  It doesn't matter if I spend all of my time reading textbooks and practicing by myself at home, I could grade myself based on the standards set within the textbook and my end result, then when the time comes that I feel I am at my apex, I could go and just prove my knowledge to earn the degrees...but this is going to put a lot of people out of business and kill jobs, so I guess it's a bad thing.	iScreme	funny	1	1	0	2012-01	1327677733		c3l7d74	ox830

But go ahead and use whatever facts you want, we can accuse god of rape if we want to because there isn't anything else for us to legitimately criticize is there?

Let's remember Santorum and Gingrich have no organization or money right now. Why be overly aggressive when he knows it is going to come down to him and Romney in the end. Then he'll have all the time in the world to point out the flaws in Mitt's rhetoric and win over America.	c3keixu	ouuan

Try to skew it more towards the 'we are victims/cops are pigs' narrative.	fece	politics	3	3	0	2012-01	1327462739	Seems like the law he was breaking is specifically designed to not allow the internal grounds of the supreme court be used to appear to endorse any political faction. You can disagree with that law, but (1) it was a law, not a made up police action, (2) the intention of the law seems to be to ensure neutrality and ideals of blind justice inside the supreme court, and (3) plenty (most? all?) public buildings have rules of decorum inside. Should we protest a library that doesn't allow mic checks because the rules of the library are to stay quiet?	c3kd8ce	ouur0

Commisar	gaming	-2	-2	0	2012-01	1327455023	Steam is the least restrictive DRM i've seen. As somebody who's weaned himself off of pirating games, (Not that I'm against it, I can just afford to not pirate now) DRM doesn't bother me all that much UNLESS it restricts how many times I can download or install or something like that.	c3kbv8l	ouv2f
