Uiaccsk	AskReddit	26	26	0	2009-01	1232951316	My gf has been dropping these annoying not-so-subtle little hints that she wants some kind of diamond jewelry this Valentine's day. Today (Sunday) she placed the newspaper on the kitchen table with the Jared's ad conveniently opened and on top of the pile. A couple days ago she was talking on the phone with her friend Kathy and when I walked in the room she suddenly started talking about the diamond necklace Kathy got for her birthday-- it was an obvious one sided conversation. My gf never cared about jewelry until she started talking more to that materialistic hoebag Kathy. I have this really cool antique necklace picked out that is totally her style and it costs $35. I was thinking of giving her that but putting it in an empty Jared's box... is that an asshole move? I like my girl but this sudden material interest is really a turn off-- should I just tell her that I will never buy her a diamond anything and explain why?	c079yjv	7se9r

People have been working on alternative sources for a long time, yes, but there is still a long way to go and many breakthroughs still needed, and there's no reason to assume that the companies already working on them will be the ones who make them. Once a quarter of all buildings are powered by solar or wind or nuclear, once a quarter of all cars run on electricity, fuel cells or biofuel then maybe we can talk about a tough entry market, but right now the field is still wide open, The Microsoft and Apple, certainly the Google of green tech probably still have founders in grade school at this point.	merper	AskReddit	1	1	0	2009-01	1232941095		c079vbp	7sa6f

0	Having used Arch + KDEmod, Fedora 10, Kubuntu 8.10, Debian Sid, and a recent openSUSE KDE 4.2 liveCD, I can honestly say that Kubuntu is by far my favorite KDE distro. I'm not saying it's necessarily the best (that boils down to personal opinion), but please give it a fair chance.	buu700	linux	2	2	0	2009-01	1232935795	Don't use Kubuntu. If you want to use Ubuntu, use gnome. If you want to use KDE, find another distro. Kubuntu is maintained by, like, three guys (exaggeration, of course, but it only has a fraction of the man power that the gnome version does). The packages often have significant breakage, and too many of the distro's config tools are in gtk/gnome. You might find a compromise in something like Mint (based on Ubuntu... how much, I don't know) or Sidux (like Ubuntu, it's based on Debian unstable), though I cannot say with any certainty because it has been a long time since I have tried either of these distros. I would definitely recommend openSUSE if you want an Ubuntu convenience like distro and want to use KDE.	c079tk0	7s7kk

One day the Windows guy left his workstation unlocked and Netware guy sat down and made a screenshot of his desktop, then set that image to be his wallpaper and he deleted the icons off the desktop and minimized that task bar to a thin grey line. Windows guy comes back and discovers that nothing happens when he clicks on the Start button nor any icons on his desktop. He reboots--same problem, so he spends the rest of the afternoon reinstalling Windows. Netware guy never lets him live it down.

If true that Asians live longer (which it isn't), there are many other confounding factors to consider before announcing that the non-existent Asian CR diet is responsible - factors like green tea, more fruits and vegetables, more exercise, etc... 3.  Asians don't live longer -- their life expectancies are currently less than in the US.  Also, the smoking epidemic took hold later so that those who are currently on-deck for lung cancer in Asia didn't smoke as much as their western counterparts.  Wait 20 years and you will see what happens in Asia, unfortunately.	circular230	Health	1	1	0	2009-01	1232916326	Is that a joke?	c079mvh	7s9i5

Happily, God intervened by means of sending an angel.  In regards to Jehu returning from a battle he won with God's help, he offered up his only daughter in lifetime service to the temple.  In Jehu's case ""burnt offering"" referred to lifelong commitment to serve God.

Media frames it as an Iraqi attack on a US plane, then taking the pilots, and we automatically have casus belli.

Dropping out of school due to unexpected pregnancy and then losing the baby to a miscarriage is fitting punishment for someone who stole a pen	bechus	AskReddit	15	15	0	2009-01	1232867047	Throughout my school career there were two Mexican girls who were also twins.  In 2nd or 3rd grade or something I had a toy pen that supposedly offered improved hearing.  I showed it off to some friends and found it missing later.  I don't know why, but I suspected one of those girls of stealing it.  I respected their property and didn't go snooping, but felt the outside of one of their backpacks and recognized the shape of my oversized pen and reached in, without looking, and grabbed it.  When she found out SHE had the audacity to tattle on me that I was going through her stuff, and I told the teacher it was my pen.  Nothing was ever done...but later in high school one of the girls got pregnant and had to drop out.  Then the next year her sister got pregnant and had to drop out and I think she had a miscarriage.  Serves those worthless thieves right.	c079cyd	7s85r

0	Well your experience is very different than my own. I moved between 5 servers until I landed on dark crag and I was able to feel like I was on a server with a reasonable population. Even then order was vastly underpopulated compared to destruction. Once again a problem with their marketing blitz. They did not focus enough on the strength of the order faction to attract players to its respective races. Getting rid of completed questing zones is not the answer. Teir 1,2 and 3 need a time based locking that is dynamic based on player population. Focusing people into areas by locking out 2 rvrpools at a time would be a good way to address the lack of focus in the lower tiers.	detaer	gaming	1	1	0	2009-01	1232852511	There is enough people on the servers they are very populated. The problem the players are not funneled enough each race has its own lvling area. If they just cut out one of the races lands then it would help alot in funneling them For each tier there are 6 Orvr Islands. That is way to much. Should be 1 per tier that would help focus the people down.	c07995x	7s5an

0	Actually you can change your vote in Reddit posts and Reddit comments; so if you convince others of the value of your post or comment you can find redress. I've often been convinced by Redditors of the value of their posts and comments and changed my votes. But there are other processes that do not offer redress and are final at least for a period of time. They are called elections. Apparently you feel elections of our officials is mob rule. Interesting that you'd call the process by which we and most of the civilized world chooses their leaders by that term. But if that's what you want to call it. Fine. Call it what you like. It's a free country. If you get a majority of the people to use your term instead of democracy it will eventually be listed as such in the dictionary. Good luck with that.

0	i feel your pain. my sister and i shared a Dell laptop that constantly had issues while it was still in warranty, but now that my mom uses it, it's had no issues. maybe all the original faulty parts have already failed and been replaced, or she's so much less reckless with her internet surfing...?	gordonjay2	WeAreTheMusicMakers	1	1	0	2009-01	1232839727	Well, I've only owned one Dell ever, so take this advice with a grain of salt, but they tend to be designed well, but made cheaply.  By this I mean that they work fine as soon as you get them, but along their lifetime they tend to develop certain small issues that can start to annoy you after a while.  Mine was a laptop and it was great for the first few months, but after I started using it for a while, I would notice little things that didn't seem to be the way they should have been.  The power button got shifted for some reason, so whenever I pressed it it would go all crooked.  The screen hinges would become loose to the point that I actually had to open it and tighten the screws (which didn't remedy it entirely).  Just little stuff like that.  But then a couple of months ago the video card just fried.  I don't know if my laptop was an outlier or what, but that really sucked.  Now I'm stuck with a toasted laptop.  What I ended up doing was buying a cheap eMachines desktop (which I had also heard bad things about) and upgrading the power supply and graphics card (I'm a gamer).  In the end, it was cheaper than the laptop and the specs were more than twice as better in almost every aspect.	c0795cr	7ru89

0	not necessarily. We don't recognize the use of the international criminal court, but we do recognize the existence of the war criminal status, and because of that, we recognize the need to prosecute them. We dont recognize the ICC because we want to judge who is and isnt a war criminal (basically, we want to keep our friends safe) so instead the U.S. refers to special courts to try selected criminals.

0	I totally agree with everything you said.  I too have been using C++ for over 10 years and feel the same way.

I used to like C++ because it was the first hardcore language I learned, but the more I learned, the more I disliked it. After 10 years of working with it, I just can't stand its inelegance, and knowing all the crap that goes on behind the scenes still boggles my mind some times. Languages like C provide simplicitly with few suprises. C is just simple, barebones programming. Languages like C#, Java, Ruby, etc. provide a lot of what C++ does, just *soooo* much cleaner, and more elegant.	c078x16	7s3we

0	Without resorting to dictionary definitions, bombing houses in another country without prior express approval from that country is a war crime unless there is a declaration of war first (and even a declared war may be illegal if e.g. it's a war of aggression). Obama did not declare war on Pakistan. I do not know whether he consulted the Pakistani government prior to the strike. It's possible that he did, but maybe he didn't. Apart from that, targeting civilian homes is almost always a war crime. I would really like to know more about the --reportedly eighteen-- casualties. Were there children among them? Without knowing all the details, I'd have to agree that the odds are high that Obama has indeed just become a war criminal. Sure, Bush Jr.'s war crimes were much greater and more numerous than Obama's quite possibly illegal acts so far -- but that doesn't excuse anything.	ropers	worldnews	40	40	0	2009-01	1232814381		c078wur	7s3qk

0	Well, I've only owned one Dell ever, so take this advice with a grain of salt, but they tend to be designed well, but made cheaply.  By this I mean that they work fine as soon as you get them, but along their lifetime they tend to develop certain small issues that can start to annoy you after a while.  Mine was a laptop and it was great for the first few months, but after I started using it for a while, I would notice little things that didn't seem to be the way they should have been.  The power button got shifted for some reason, so whenever I pressed it it would go all crooked.  The screen hinges would become loose to the point that I actually had to open it and tighten the screws (which didn't remedy it entirely).  Just little stuff like that.  But then a couple of months ago the video card just fried.  I don't know if my laptop was an outlier or what, but that really sucked.  Now I'm stuck with a toasted laptop.  What I ended up doing was buying a cheap eMachines desktop (which I had also heard bad things about) and upgrading the power supply and graphics card (I'm a gamer).  In the end, it was cheaper than the laptop and the specs were more than twice as better in almost every aspect.	eOgas	WeAreTheMusicMakers	2	2	0	2009-01	1232812205		c078wao	7ru89

I have processed death in many ways and am here, facing the possible death of the most important person in the world to me, the one who gave me my own life. I was not looking for a way to lie to myself.

0	Don't make love to the men. There was one man in the town I grew up in who liked men. He also had one of the first automobiles around, but we didn't call it an automobile back then. We called it a Go-Fast-Box. Someone stole it one night and it was found in on the railroad tracks, which we called ground ladders. See, back in the day we didn't have normal ladders so we had to plant a tree whenever we needed to get up high. They started calling the town Treeville because there were so many trees. One time my friend Uziah fell out of a tree and he got soft in the head and wouldn't eat cheese no more. We used to go out on a Friday night wearing the finest pantaloons we had and dancing with the dairy maids. It was hard because there were so many trees sometimes you'd swing your dairy maid into a tree and she wouldn't dance with you anymore. That was OK though because it was usually about that time of night that the bootleggers came into town and it you had three nickles you could get a gallon of moonshine. See, we'd take the moonshine and feed it to the cows and then have ourselves a good old drunk cow fight. Oh, those were the days until the cows were killed by the dustbowl.	aldenhg	happy	10	10	0	2009-01	1232761817	Make love to me.	c078lwq	7ry24

We used to say ""You're like a reindeer in an orange grove"" when fresh kids were freaking out in 'Nam. But that was before we got redeployed to Pyongyang and that's where I met Maisy. Oh boy did she have some gams and bazungas out to the Sea of Japan! She got sent back stateside when the locals started calling her ""chu-dat"" which means something like ""hot momma with loose morals"" and she was replaced by a rough trick named Rowdy. He was from Kansas where they used to have all the bees. See, they'd take the bees from other sates with a big vacuum and save 'em all for themselves. That's why they called it the beesting honey state back in the day, but that all changed when they discovered they were growing corn and you could sell corn overseas for more money than the honey! Oh boy did things get crazy during the corn craze. You could get two bushels on the quarter and three on a dime!

The people pushing for ""reasonable"" restrictions, like licensing, are the ones that want to ultimately disarm the people. Licensing is not an end goal, it is one step towards their ultimate goal. Your analogy of cars and guns fails to take that into account, and is thus a weak analogy. Obama, Clinton, Kennedy, Feinstein, are all very anti-gun and have the support of organizations like Handgun Control Inc., The Brady Foundation, etc. whose goal is to disarm ordinary citizens. If all they wanted to do was license gun owners like vehicles and that was then end of it, then your argument would be supportable. It is not the end of it, just a first step."

What that would be specifically is difficult, but a hard line would have to be drawn.  ""24 to 28 weeks"" is too vague of a guideline and doctors at the current time are unable to determine when (with 100% accuracy) a fetus is alive.  If the fetus is developed enough to be alive it ceases to be her choice (again, my opinion) unless it threatens her life.  It has always been and will probably be (for a while) a touchy issue."	washcapsfan37	politics	1	1	0	2009-01	1232741415	So what should it be? It seems that the only other solution people propose is to outlaw abortion altogether, which clearly does not take into account 1) the fact that terminating a zygote (and other early stages of fetal development) are about the same (or lesser) moral equivalent to killing animals for meat, clothing, and sport and 2) the fact that the mother, who is sustaining life for the fetus, is an independent being with rights of her own and should not be forced to continue a dangerous or unwanted pregnancy because she is an adult with bodily autonomy. This is why I say that *your* approach is too simplistic; the choice should reside with the mother and her physician, not with the law.	c078cx0	7ruq1

""24 to 28 weeks"" is far too inaccurate and too simplistic.  Neither the pregnant woman nor her doctor can currently tell when life begins, so it is important that if an abortion occurs that viability is not the only factor (at least in my opinion)."	washcapsfan37	politics	1	1	0	2009-01	1232738247	Luckily, someone has written it for you! Roe v. Wade specifies that a pregnancy may be terminated for any reason up to viability. This occurs somewhere between 24 and 28 weeks. The choice whether or when to terminate a pregnancy should be made by the pregnant woman and her physician depending on many factors, so no, a law specifying the exact second at which it becomes unethical is far too simplistic.	c078b85	7ruq1

BraveSirRobin	reddit.com	2	2	0	2009-01	1232731191	Yes, most of us would be ok with it except for the ad people, and like I said, they are the ones footing the bill for your CSI or Lost or whichever poison is your preference. In essence, the network is only concerned about you in as far as you will rate their shows, and that, only for the sake of attracting advertisers who will pay more for the privilege to bombard you with their products.	c0787lo	7rs6r

0	Feel free to provide some links to examples. Roads have been around long before government, but we didn't have good, paved roads until government stepped in. Yes, electricity was done in the private sector, but they were only interested in wiring the cities. If government hadn't stepped in we would have vast areas of the country where people would have to run a diesel generator to turn on the lights. The reason is simple. A private company wouldn't run 5 miles of utility poles and power lines to service a couple of families. They would never make their money back. And as for police, I'm not sure where you got that from. Sure, there were private security forces that charged businesses and the rich for their services, but since the dawn of this country we've have police, sheriffs, etc. which have kept the peace.	aliengoods1	Libertarian	1	1	0	2009-01	1232719591	All of the services you mention used to be privately owned until the government stepped in and monopolized them for itself and crowded out any competition.  Every one of them could be run by private owners in a free market.  It's been so long now that nobody can imagine life without the government running these services, thus you think it is impossible.

Psychosomatic illness is a terrible thing and is extremely common. You will get on here and insist that it's a physical malady because you love your dad, don't want to admit he was insane and that anything that can be done to ease people's suffering who have this ""physical illness"" should be done.  You're describing a bat shit crazy person who was a dope addict who had symptoms without disease process when he met stress in his life and regressed into rocking back and forth and banging his head on the wall while verbally expressing suicidal ideation.  In short, he was nuts. Neither he nor you would ever admit that because you love him, it's embarrassing and there is a social stigma attached to it. Big pharma knows you'll validate a fake disease process to avoid the truth. They post a wiki article that says it's not fake so people will feel comfortable in seeking drug treatment to a problem which is obviously psychological and that is extrememly unethical to treat with anything but anti-psychotics.

If the rest of the country is just giving a paragraph or two in each text book, though, then all the uproar is going to start sounding a lot more like a bunch of people that like to hear themselves talk instead of people trying to protect science.

Though I would probably agree that I wouldn't have considered this a national disaster, an insurrection, or a threat from external or internal militant forces, I would have to say that an influx of 2 million+ people is a pretty big thing for a city of 600,000. And as for serving in two offices, I believe the Constitution is referring to two elected offices. Even so, I was not paid for my duties as a special policeman and that was a volunteer position that any citizen can be appointed to, it's not an office.	genuinepolitician	politics	1	1	0	2009-01	1232688266		c077w2i	7rrh1
