The weather is always the same. Who needs them to tell us what we already know. Example 2: years ago he solved the problem of chaotic downtown traffic by...removing all the traffic lights and signage.

It is quite remarkable, if UNIX tools are so effective and given how widespread UNIX variants are, that none of the many UNIX old-hands I've met is enough of an expert to support the premise here. I appreciate that personal experience may not be representative, but at some point you have to start wondering where all the experts are, and if the tools are so powerful *and* so widespread, how come none of the people you've ever met have managed to reach the level of expertise where the power of the tools really shows.

Big fucking whoop.  Power never changes hands.  On the real issues, there is absolutely no one in government standing up for the rights of ANY constituency other than the ruling class.  They let the stupid public content themselves with bickering over semantics, while they keep real issues about human rights off the table.

Introducing an adult, who is *trained* in eliciting trust in children, and *trained* in helping children with shame issues is not ""interfering."" The school psychologists and counselors in the schools I've worked at were among the most popular adults with the students and the kids who went to see them were viewed as ""lucky."" Of course, it will depend on the quality of the school system, but if the counselor is shaming and scary, there is something *very* wrong."	anonymgrl	AskReddit	3	3	0	2009-01	1232648453	I agree more with the below comment that the parents should spend more time observing the child's behavior on their own before they seek interference from a counselor. I don't think that a counselor is absolutely necessary in this circumstance because it's obvious that the child already has shame in the things he's doing. Introducing him to a stranger that he's just supposed to trust right off the bat is silly if he can't even tell the truth about spilling something.

0	I see your point, but you still can't tell me that religion has a serious bearing on our national political discourse.  As to the Bishops in the Lords, well its only a small number and frankly, I don't mind too much, they do represent a view that is popular in the UK.  If we are going to have unelected people in our upper house (and I would argue we should) I don't think including some senior religious figures is a bad thing (as long as they are a small minority, I wouldn't want any particular group to have any significant amount of power).	ajehals	atheism	1	1	0	2009-01	1232624089	Yeah it would really suck if we had clergy in parliament only on the fact that they are clergy.

If that were the case, I'd have an extra 20 inches added to my dong if I were normal weight.

Nobody really envisioned this specific instantiation of how they'd be combined at design time, but the totally envisioned that one would combine these pieces and create new and innovative approaches. That was kind of the idea and why they tried to keep these different areas as orthogonal as possible.	xcbsmith	programming	1	1	0	2009-01	1232613948	It blows your mind only because the techniques within it are so far away from what the language was designed to support that their implementations have become ludicrously complicated. The underlying ideas are mostly very simple, and implemented in mostly very simple ways in other languages. It's cute that you can do those things in C++ in the same way that it's cute that you can write a compiler in Brainf\*ck.	c0775u6	6y6lr

If you recall the assassination attempt on Reagan, the bullet that hit him did so on a ricochet. It was also a .22 pistol.	bobpaul	technology	6	6	0	2009-01	1232613726	I have worn body armour in combat. It is possible the suit or under suit could have been tighly woven Kevlar which would stop up to a 9mm round unless they were right on top of you. If you want to stop a high powered rifle round, say 7.62 and above you need the kevlar plus a porceline plate insert which would had made him look like a turtle with a suit on. It is possible he wore some Kevlar underneath but I doubt anybody aiming at killing him would use less than 7.62 which would render his Kevlar suit useless. It being goverent making the decision I am sure they wasted the money on it regardless.	c0775si	7rev8

I guess when you just take everything on ""faith"" there really isn't much room for thinking, is there?"	carldamien	Christianity	1	1	0	2009-01	1232606834	Well, I may agree that women should not receive severe punishment for having an abortion, but I don't think it should be based upon how well you can stump an anti-abortionist.  Using the other end of the measuring stick, you could ask a similar question to a pro-choice activist that also requires some thinking, and I'll bet a majority aren't prepared to answer it.  A fair debate would be if both parties were prepared by receiving the answer beforehand and given ample time to create a defense.  You may disagree with me on this, but also consider that morality shouldn't be decided based on how knowledgeable or prepared a given party on one side of the moral debate is.  It's like Kant's ethics, even if you make the right choice, if you do it for the wrong reason you're still being immoral.  While I may believe that abortion should be allowed within a reasonable amount of time from conception, if I arrive at that conclusion in the wrong way then my conclusion should not be considered a good one since new conclusions might instead miss the mark and be mistakenly formed using the same moral method.	c0774a7	7re7n

0	I don't understand how wealthy people or their businesses could become rulers without there being a rulership class or position. As long as there isn't a ruling class or positions of rule then it seems to me that some corporations having free reign somewhere seems benign as without a ruler to impose them as a monopoly then they can be boycotted to extinction or compliance. Without a ruler to create it, there would be no such thing as corporate 'personhood' or 'rights'.	sblinn	Anarchism	1	1	0	2009-01	1232597540		c0771ax	7ra6p

What we have in the US is a mixture of Capitalism and Socialism and it works much better than the previous robber baron child labor sweatshop days that led up to the Great Depression. Pure Capitalism failed in the US and what we have now is an improvement: a balance between the drive for profits and the drive for fairness. Not a perfect balance mind you. But a balance nonetheless. Pure communism and pure capitalism both fail but for different reasons. A blending of competitive capitalism and social fairness succeeds.

0	You've actually gotten the point quite correctly -- it's not just that negative or inconclusive results are harder to publish, it's also an issue of competition. Even among university researchers people don't want their competitors to know what not to do and would rather see research money go to waste than have someone else win a prize or an extra grant simply because he'd seen an inconclusive paper and found out that hypotheses needed to head in an entirely different direction.	skazzleprop	science	2	2	0	2009-01	1232581012	I would suspect drug co.

I'm in college and my room mate has a girlfriend who spends the night literally every night. Now to begin with, I didn't have much of a problem with this. My room mate is like a brother to me, and frankly having someone else over didn't bother me too much. As it turns out now, she really gets on my nerves. Normally I would talk to my room mate about it, and ask to sleep in her room (down the hall), but the problem with that is they already spend all their waking time in her room, and I'm afraid if they started sleeping in here they'd just be hanging out in my room... which from my opinion is even worse.

In the case of Joe Camel, cigarettes are legal only to 18+, so marketing should NOT be aimed at anyone younger.  There may be a debate on whether that marketing was actually effective for children but either way, marking for something that _by law_ is unable to be sold to children should have its marketing restricted _by law_.  Something like soda is not prohibited to children by law, and needs to be up to parents to decide.  If anything, a positive campaign against these types of drinks should be used in an effort to educate parents on the dangers of too much sugar/caffeine in a child's diet.	c076qx5	7rea8

If we use ""human DNA + brain waves"" as the ""cut off point"", which I personally don't mind considering, then that's fine, but it would seem to logically then hold that having a non-medically necessary abortion at that point should be a crime just as much as infanticide at birth, doesn't it?

LoopHead	worldnews	7	7	0	2009-01	1232554541	All you Israel haters fail to realize that Israel is not creating this divisiveness!  Israel is not creating terrorism in Gaza. It's always been there.

Also, maybe this man's little girls wouldn't have died if the members of Hamas who started this whole business by launching rockets into Israel didn't hide in schools and in people's homes.  You also fail to realize that Israel is an absolute no win situation vis a vis Gaza and the Palestinians.

0	I am not going to try to do the math, but I think that even in that case you get lighter. The mass of the anomaly is still trivial compared to the mass of the Earth. So while you are getting closer to the anomaly you are still getting further from the surface of the Earth.

Of course the TV execs will blame the internet or give some other asinine excuse, but when you cancel something like Arrested Development, there's really no way you can escape blame. I see the future of TV being reality shows, sports and dumb talk shows. Idiocracy seems more and more relevant every day.	junkmale	AskReddit	3	3	0	2009-01	1232548847	I'm just sick of all the cruddy Reality TV shows, and rehashes of rehashes.

However, at least with Internet news you get to choose what articles and websites to read from  (I tend to ignore The Sun, FOX and The Daily Mail articles on Reddit).

0	Apocalypse Now  (uhm, then)	Megasphaera	worldnews	1	1	0	2009-01	1232534210	I've seen horrors... horrors that you've seen. But you have no right to call me a murderer. You have a right to kill me. You have a right to do that... but you have no right to judge me. It's impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those who do not know what horror means. Horror. Horror has a face... and you must make a friend of horror. Horror and moral terror are your friends. If they are not then they are enemies to be feared. They are truly enemies. I remember when I was with Special Forces. Seems a thousand centuries ago. We went into a camp to inoculate the children. We left the camp after we had inoculated the children for Polio, and this old man came running after us and he was crying. He couldn't see. We went back there and they had come and hacked off every inoculated arm. There they were in a pile. A pile of little arms. And I remember... I... I... I cried. I wept like some grandmother. I wanted to tear my teeth out. I didn't know what I wanted to do. And I want to remember it. I never want to forget it. I never want to forget. And then I realized... like I was shot... like I was shot with a diamond... a diamond bullet right through my forehead. And I thought: My God... the genius of that. The genius. The will to do that. Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure. And then I realized they were stronger than we. Because they could stand that these were not monsters. These were men... trained cadres. These men who fought with their hearts, who had families, who had children, who were filled with love... but they had the strength... the strength... to do that. If I had ten divisions of those men our troubles here would be over very quickly. You have to have men who are moral... and at the same time who are able to utilize their primordial instincts to kill without feeling... without passion... without judgment... without judgment. Because it's judgment that defeats us.	c076dy8	7rals

Even though it's not what you're looking for, try calling them and asking serious questions to get over the serious phone conversation task.  It may not be directed towards the matter you are interested in, but it may help get you over that phone phobia.  And remember, be confident.  With women and jobs, confidence counts.

0	I think the US is at a crossroads right now.  The state of affairs is not as bad as you are putting it.  The US still has enormous influence and power, and you would be a fool to deny that.  What I will give you, though, is that this next administration will probably make it or break it.  If Obama does extremely well, the US will have more power than ever; if, however, he fails to live up to his rhetoric, the US will spiral into a downward trajectory that will be near-impossible to pull out of.  At that point, it won't have lost all of its clout, but it'll have lost its status as the sole superpower and will be slightly more obligated to listen to the wishes of the rest of the world.	sumzup	worldnews	1	1	0	2009-01	1232490955		c07613t	7r4y2

0	"Because ComCast is a cable company, their network is designed differently from other networks. It is designed to move data away from the head unit, so upstream traffic is less efficient. Two-way TCP/IP traffic was an afterthought. Also, it is still largely ""shared bandwidth"", so your neighbor's traffic has an effect on your traffic. I chose DSL partly because it is dedicated bandwidth rather than shared, and the TOS that ComCast has is unacceptable to me. I get less speed, but also less headaches from the ISP."

0	This is nothing more than fear-mongering war-mongering bullshit from NewsMax. First of all the NIE (which included all of the US intelligence agencies) found that Iran stopped their program to develop a nuclear weapon by 2003. Furthermore the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which has inspectors in Iran monitoring their nuclear programs recently reported that Iran would need to kick all of the IAEA inspectors out to start back up a nuclear weapons program and then would need between six months to a year after that to process enough weapons grade uranium to make a single nuclear weapon. Nuclear reactors (for producing electrical power) require enriched uranium (which is reactor grade uranium of about 5% U235) as fuel for those reactors. Weapons grade uranium is around 90% U235 and currently the uranium Iran is enriching is only approaching the reactor grade level in the amounts needed for the nuclear reactors they've built and are building. If Iran tries to enrich beyond reactor grade the IAEA inspectors will know and will let the UN know forcing a global reaction long before Iran has sufficient material for even a single nuclear weapon. If Iran kicks out the IAEA inspectors it will also trigger a global reaction from the UN.  Long before Iran gets to a point where they have enough weapons grade uranium for a nuclear weapon the UN and the existing nuclear powers would step in and stop it by any and all means necessary. Fear-mongering in order to frighten people into starting a war with a Middle Eastern Muslim nation is how the Bush Administration and the neocons got us into Iraq. Now they are trying to get us into Iran. Doing so will further stretch our military (probably to the breaking point) and needlessly kill more Americans and Middle Easterners. Don't be fooled by NewsMax and the rest of the neocons driving us into another war.	IrishJoe	politics	1	1	0	2009-01	1232475797	Experts: Iran Will Have Nuke This Year	c075th9	7r47l
