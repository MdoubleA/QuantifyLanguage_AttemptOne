Digger123	photography	1	1	0	2009-01	1233183460	"This might sound really crazy but after buying an arsenal of really good lenses I now only buy $10 lenses at thrift stores. I buy a bunch of ""camera body covers"" (the part that covers the body when the lens is off) and convert them to accept any lens. I take a Dremel tool and cut out the part in the center. Then I tape off the part of the new (used) lens with cotton over the glass portion. I cut the lens metal until it will fit into the plastic body cover and then hot glue it into place. I only shoot in manual so I don't need the fancy schmancy auto settings. This might sound too complicated or stupid to many people but I've gotten some amazing lenses and really cool photos from $1 plastic lenses. I've made macro lenses, LensBaby style lenses, super telephoto lenses and Holga style lenses. Even supposedly damaged lenses (mold, dust) can turn out really interesting pics.

Erudecorp	Christianity	1	1	0	2009-01	1233181241	What I've read of Sam Harris (End of Faith, Letter to a Christian America) leads me to believe that he would agree to a large extent with point 1. His emphasis is more that certain beliefs are violating the rights of others, impeding scientific endeavors that could help many people, harming children and endangering humanity, and so people with those dangerous beliefs should not be allowed to freely believe what they do. Many aspects of his position scare me, but I don't think it's necessarily in conflict with point #1.	c07c0eb	7shuz

I only shoot in manual so I don't need the fancy schmancy auto settings.

MrDanger	Marijuana	6	6	0	2009-01	1233162799	I find it odd that you think that the representatives in Congress are at all interested in the views of their constituency.  They're not.  To do so would be damaging to their careers.  In a single-vote plurality election system, the optimal position is with 2 identical parties operating only to increase the power of the offices they are trying to get elected to.  Supporting any initiative from the public that decreased their power would move them away from this optimal position and cause them to start losing elections.  It's simply unwise for them to do so.

The unfortunate thing about your story is that you had to suffer in ignorance for so very long.  Lots of kids suffer intense guilt for their masturbation, due to their parents freaking out and telling them to never do it again and such.  Nowadays, parents go *WAY* over the top and insist that their children must have been molested.  They wholeheartedly accept the idea that ""children are not sexual beings"" which is a pop culture absurd lie without a shred of truth to it that Roseanne Barr popularized in the 90s.  It is EXTREMELY damaging to kids.  The idea that sexuality is a ""loss of innocence"" is completely absurd.  The idea that there might be people who should not be taught about their sexuality because exercising it might ""hurt them"" is absurd.  But we've got a long way to go before that changes.  Our society is filled with people who were made neurotic about their sexuality and their body by abusive parents thinking they were doing the right thing."	otakucode	sex	3	3	0	2009-01	1233161754		c07br9o	7svmt

0	What has that got to do with them thinking they have a right to legislate the actions of their citizens when they are in a different country?  Just because they have a good reason to prevent sex tourism does not translate into justifying making laws like this.  The fireworks laws are made to protect people, also.  They don't pass laws making it illegal for you to play with fireworks when you're in another country.  One would think the idea they CAN make such laws comes dangerously close to the old idea that citizens are the property of the government.	otakucode	sex	1	1	0	2009-01	1233160665	It is to try and prevent sex tourism.	c07bqrq	7svmt

It's a bit like saying that if you think people have the right to fair pay and not being treated like slave labor, you shouldn't shop at Walmart. Those kinds of rights are (well, at least should be) non-negotiable and not be subject to influence from individual economical choices.

Say you want chicken, but you want an Asian recipe.  You could compile a list of ingredients common in Asian food (might want to make it country specific) and have the search automatically tag those on to chicken.  This would make it so that you would only really need to put in the protein or main item and then you'd get something close to what you wanted.  I know that concept works well in book form (Silver Spoon), but it centers around Italian cuisine, so you might be able to use that as a reference.  Good start though.	c07bk2w	7stmp

People are going through it all over the place. America has changed. Don't think you're a failure. In the past, people like you would make a picket sign and go marching the streets demanding the necessities every single human being deserves. I've been eating the same crap food for a week and a half now. My car has a quarter tank of gas and I've got to make it to work and back a couple more times before I get my first paycheck (I just started a new job). I know you're basically all by yourself and there's no one to help you, but why don't you try to find someone with a room to rent, so you can Reddit (and maybe look for a better job) from somewhere other than your little office there? People rent rooms for relatively cheap and there's no contracts to sign. If you had a rudimentary job you could afford it, and save any (tiny) extras you made. Just some ideas. Also, look for some tips online for what to do if you suddenly find yourself homeless. Good luck brother. I'll send you some money in a couple of days if you e-mail me your PayPal account address.	cometparty	reddit.com	21	21	0	2009-01	1233129870		c07bjv3	7sytf

It has either red or green lights that constantly flash --:-- or 12:00, depending on whether the VCR was made in the US or Japan.  No VCRs are made in the US.  Back in the 1980s and 1990s, when people didn't have anything to do, they would drive anywhere between five and ten miles to lease a smaller black plastic box, which would be temporarily devoured by the VCR box.  It was only during this time that the lights on the front of the VCR didn't say 12:00.  The life of the small box would slowly wither away, and its life would flash before the viewer's eyes on the television above the VCR.  People usually hoped that the small box had an interesting life so that they could be entertained for a short while.  This all seems very sad, but the VCR, in addition to killing the poor small plastic box, would also slowly bring it back to life.  Some people were impatient, and purchased another box that would bring the small box back to life sooner.  It was very important in those times to bring the small box back to life before ending the lease, so that its soul would not have a chance to pass on to the afterlife.  After that point, a soul recovery fee of $0.99 per day was levied on the lessee.	c07bgem	7sxp1

And at the same time, tell me how much was found in these products containing HFCS.  The article obviously leaves these helpful facts out.  Of course that would remove all sensationalism from the piece.  No one wants that, now do we.

Spazsquatch	AskReddit	2	2	0	2009-01	1233105333	I'd say Alien is the single best sci-fi horror ever made, with the Thing at #2. It has perfect pacing, mood, suspense, and (at the time) some very original concepts. The sequel, Aliens, was a big let down for me because it felt very generic with the whole military team 'kill it with big guns' thing and that Goram brat kid always screaming. Still a good movie, but no where near the brilliance of the original.	c07bc6u	7sqj1

This would be the same as what you would do if you were going overseas for several months or if you're car was going to need extensive work and was currently un-drivable.  My insurance company has done this for me on several occasions including during a multi-month stint in Europe.  They only charge something like $5/month when it's in that 'mode'.  That way you're policy is still in effect, but you basically have no cars you are driving on it.	UncleOxidant	reddit.com	10	10	0	2009-01	1233099719		c07b9q4	7sv8p

0	"Yeah, it's the same thing with the Milgram studies, the Stanford prison experiments, things like that.  Their results are there to caution people, to most importantly make people doubt themselves.  Most people go around assuming they know everything about themselves, knowing how they would react in different situations, going off of sheer intuition.  Intuition is almost ALWAYS wrong.  And when you rely on intuition and don't get introspective, when the time comes to listen to an authority figure and shock someone or you're given the opportunity to control someone else's circumstances who has ""done wrong"", you are going to fall into the statistical average behavior most likely.  If you know it's likely, you might avoid the situation or try to avoid the behavior.... we still have soldiers going to Iraq even though they know there is no legitimate reason to go there and kill people, however.  Just having the information available isn't enough, we really need to teach people to stop trusting themselves so implicitly and pay more attention to research."	otakucode	worldnews	0	0	0	2009-01	1233098573	I hate when science is used as a justification to give into evil rather than a cause to rise above it.	c07b99f	7suf3

Some will plan out the performance move for move others will just wing it and make sure the predetermined ""outcome"" looks good. When you see teh wrestlers with their heads ducked near each otehr as one is picking the otehr up he's wispering what to do next, ""whip me, dropkick, snapmare"" or whatever code they would use. The ref usually can help plan a match and can relay instructions from one guy to another. In the big shows like TNA and WWE they have writers who have long storylines built which list who wins what match and how. If it's a smaller show with a bunch of journeymen the guy with a bigger name will usually win or if he does lose it has to be because of nefarious reasons and even then he should get instant revenge because he won't be in town next week."	logicalnoise	pics	2	2	0	2009-01	1233092989	i always wondered ,is every single move choreographed ? or is the winner determined and they just do whatever the hell they want ?	c07b6zs	7svgm

0	Because your child has relations with less than a dozen people means they live in a box.  Because your child is prevented from experiencing any sense of danger, loss, or pain, it means they live in a box.  The human brain evolved so that extreme experiences, the kind that disturb you and leave you pondering them for weeks, whether thoughtfully or in horror, are what make the human brain develop.  Lack of those experiences results in a lack of development.  Learning from a childrens TV show is not brain development.  The incalculable chaos of the real world is what the brain developed to feed on.  And replacing it with a system of radically lower entropy is harmful.	otakucode	gaming	1	1	0	2009-01	1233091205	Just because we aren't being chased by predators or on the verge of starvation doesn't mean we live in a box. As a parent it's your job to A) understand where your child is at developmentally and B) construct playtime/learning time accordingly so they reach their maximum potential.	c07b65i	7sl7w

Sure, the corporate jet costs 40 million, plus $20,000 dollars to fuel each time it flies, another $7000.00 in crew costs, and rental costs for each executive flight center, on-going monthly maintenance, insurance, and equipment costs. But why can't we think of THEIR feelings??? They've been through so much, some of them have had to sell to one of their 12 vacation homes, cut their 100 million dollar bonuses, and now we are going to request they fly on a measly $3000.00 1st class ticket ($12,000 for oversees), require them to go to the standard terminal instead of the executive terminal, require them to go through the standard security lines and mingle with the lower class??

0	If we could get the majority of people to reject the idea that killing people is an example of bravado, it would be a good start.  Killing human beings is something we are hard-wired to NOT do.  Not even if we're doing it in self-defense.  But what red-blooded guy is going to admit that if it came down to him or someone else, he would probably let himself be killed?  It's the truth.  Military training teaches people to react before their mind has a chance to put the brakes on.  Unfortuntely, after they act reflexively and have killed someone, they have to deal with the repercussions.  Those who run the military don't care, they have been involved in drumming up business of the defense and construction industry for so long they don't even remember what defending a country would be like.	otakucode	science	6	6	0	2009-01	1233085372	MRI testing in America has revealed startling differences in the brains of soldiers with combat stress	c07b3j5	7srzq

This would provide a decent mechanism for assuring accountability.  Getting rid of the fractional reserve system (regardless of where you stand on the issue generally) would be catastrophic in the very short term and massively exacerbate the problems that the US and the world faces at this moment, doubly so if no one else follows suit.  The US would end up defaulting on the debt it owes and probably find it very hard to recover from the damage already done to its economy.	ajehals	Economics	2	2	0	2009-01	1233071687	Dennis Kucinich States His Intention To Put The Federal Reserve Under Government Control	c07axl0	7sp1g

0	They are **responding** to a people who are outnumbers and outgunned. And they are not all that outnumbered. Should Israel just let Hamas kill Israeli civilians? Should Israel give Hamas more weapons to even things up? Or maybe, just maybe, you might want to treat Hamas like real people and consider them responsible for their actions. Then the issue might be that Hamas has to stop attacking Israeli civilians, Hamas has to stop firing from densely populated areas. Perhaps Hamas can be seen as responsible for their actions.	matts2	worldpolitics	1	1	0	2009-01	1233058852	I have no respect for Hamas but lt's not act like Israel is fighting an Enemy on par with Nazis.

Get in a car and drive to a friend a couple hundred miles away (don't speed and try not to get pulled over obviously), and stay with them until the story has broken. All your contact with this friend should be through alias email accounts accessed on public computer terminals, or via payphones (even then, try to speak in basic code, trying not to be specific. I'd arrange how this works via a false email from a public computer terminal beforehand). Leave a note for your friends/family telling them that you'll be gone for a while, but don't tell them where or for exactly how long. Meanwhile you must contact the media and get the story published ASAP! Contact the ACLU and US dept. of Labor. This may not be exactly what you need but they will point you in the right direction.

0	I think the big thing would be child support rules.  In divorces without children there doesn't seem to be any huge disadvantage for either party.   The split property is probably small in comparison to either person's future earning capacity. This would leave the man better off on average because men tend to earn more.  In cases where there are kids it could easily be different. I know a heck of a lot of guys (and a few women) who are putting half their weekly pay into child support.  I wouldn't be surprised if both men and women here had lower wealth after divorce (w/kids) here.  Then again whoever doesn't get custody has more opportunity to work overtime.	bCabulon	women	1	1	0	2009-01	1233032510	But I think a lot of issues, like women undertaking a larger share of the child-rearing, as well as stopping work to take care of children etc is going to be at fairly similar levels.  It might not be exactly the same, but I'm sure the conclusions in general hold true.  Still, it would be interesting to see a study done on the US and other western countries.	c07aoe5	7silc

0	"Without a doubt their action caused his death.  The article is not clear, but it is possible (and they hinted at it) that this gentleman was never made aware of this ""limiter"".  As such, it is possible this thing tripped in the middle of the night and the guy could have died in his sleep or awoken already overcome by the cold.  Here in Ohio they cannot shut off utilities in Winter.  For this exact reason.  For them to try and deflect blame on the neighbors is appalling.  The reason they get away with this garbage is the people being killed have no one to sue the utility company for wrongful death."	wbeavis	reddit.com	13	13	0	2009-01	1233023956	I see a lot of comments in this thread indicating what a travesty this is and how horrible the power company is. I must disagree, in principle, that this is entirely the power company's fault. I will grant some amount of guilt (ethically) on the power company. Step back and think about it though: the guy was 93. If he was still mentally all there he must have known it was really cold. He also knew his power was off. He did not take any actions that we know of to prevent his death. He sat there, SLOWLY dying. There are just to many questions to answer before we know if the power company is more or less to blame. They could have created this situation, but that is no certain thing. Maybe the cold caused the man to lose his senses to the point where he could not call for help? Maybe he wanted to die: 93 is pretty old. It is the human condition of living and dying. In this case it was a cold and lonely tale where you really want the power company to empathize with an old man and show him a little human decency -- but I don't know that they were ethically obligated or responsible for his death to any great extent. I like to look at things sort of like a civil suit: what percentage of responsibility were those that caused the harm liable for. I would say power company 30% old man 70%.	c07ald2	7sm62

In every other war it is considered good thing for one side to protect its citizens and soldiers, the side that loses is more is consider the loser, not the moral victor. Seriously, do you see the U.S. as wrong because they killed thousands times more Japanese Civilians as the Japanese killed Americans? Do you see Japan as morally right because they lost at least 3 times as many soldiers as we did in most battles (and up to 10 times as many in plenty of them)? Or do you look at those numbers and say we won the war and they lost?	matts2	worldpolitics	1	1	0	2009-01	1233017769		c07ajcz	7silz

0	Ive yet to see much criticism regarding Adobe's Motion Editor built into Flash CS4. This is by far the most frustrating time line based animation ive ever used. I have extensive experience in After Effects and Flash. The custom easing settings are brutal, you cant control the keyframes from the main timeline. trying to edit an animation to make changes takes forever since your custom easing curve wont follow. I have a separate monitor solely for the motion editor's bloated size and I still feel constricted by the UI. I appreciate the effort put into this tool but it was executed HORRIBLY.	karatechops	programming	1	1	0	2009-01	1233005343	Blog about crappy UIs in Adobe software	c07aeii	7siam

Gaza tried to replicate that success but Hamas and Fatah nepotism led to the diminshment of any such prospect, all the materials bought by the world bank and other Jewish donors for Gazans were looted... and when Israel shut its borders (as was their right), 1000s of tons of produce were dumped to rot causing losses to the Israeli buyers too.	c07ae9d	7siud

MoBe	Economics	1	1	0	2009-01	1232993473	"Peter Schiff is not wrong. he is probably 100% right, only he's missing the timing. And he's said on several occasions that he has seen that very often in his predictions he's getting the fundamentals right but fails (completely) to get the timing right. When you get the timing wrong of course you loose money short term. Ive been investing under the pretense that Schiff/Faber is right for some time now and i quickly saw that i had to adjust because of time frame issues, but basically you do the same thing just on another scale / ""frequency"" (don't know how to explain) / try to factor in that maybe schiffworld isn't going to happen in 10 years and ive made a very nice chunk indeed doing so and it will continue. The marked is not a binary place where schiff is wrong wrong wrong or right right right, its more like wrong, less wrong, ok, right, very right, where anything can happen in between, the investment strategy must be adapted to this. I don't know anybody who's personally spent money on mr. schiffs fund but the way hes been advocating gold i would assume his portfolio would have a lot of gold in it and gold has gone like crazy, either hes not putting hes gold where his mouth is or something is fishy..."	c07a8xa	7sf0s

Was it crusty?	donttaseme	AskReddit	1	1	0	2009-01	1232960279	Throughout my school career there were two Mexican girls who were also twins.  In 2nd or 3rd grade or something I had a toy pen that supposedly offered improved hearing.  I showed it off to some friends and found it missing later.  I don't know why, but I suspected one of those girls of stealing it.  I respected their property and didn't go snooping, but felt the outside of one of their backpacks and recognized the shape of my oversized pen and reached in, without looking, and grabbed it.  When she found out SHE had the audacity to tattle on me that I was going through her stuff, and I told the teacher it was my pen.  Nothing was ever done...but later in high school one of the girls got pregnant and had to drop out.  Then the next year her sister got pregnant and had to drop out and I think she had a miscarriage.

0	Aside from the frugal living and job search and whatnot, try learning a new skill or area of expertise, perhaps one that you have always been dreaming of, that could be put to good use somehow. Maybe it could help you land a job, or perhaps become a skill necessary to your new job, or maybe you could make money off the new skill as a new source of income. You'll stay productive and always learning, while building towards the future.	ajwarren	AskReddit	5	5	0	2009-01	1232955052		c079zhd	7sf6t

0	Unfortunately, pollution doesn't stop nicely and turn around at state borders. That makes it a federal issue.	madfrogurt	news	5	5	0	2009-01	1232952692	To all the people saying yes or no based on their opinion of fuel emissions standards, I think you are missing the point. Since when is this is a federal issue? I believe states deserve a lot more sovereignty than they are currently allotted. This is just one more thing states legislators should be able to rule and finally are being given the appropriate power two. If California decides to go 5% zero emissions while Texas says fuck it, you can drive a coal powered locomotive, let it be. When California goes broke and/or Texas opens up a whole in the atmosphere and pollution increases 800%, maybe we'll learn something.	c079yw8	7sdo3
