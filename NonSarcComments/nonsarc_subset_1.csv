However, the actions of one person in the party does not represent the message of the party as a whole. Also, keep in mind that chairman elections are similar to primaries, and if I recall correctly Obama wasn't exactly going around saying how moderate he was during the Democrat primary.	jk1150	politics	4	4	0	2009-01	1233441364		c07e51r	7tub1

0	Where I work, we have some offshore developers. Its vital that we can move people around quickly. Overcomplicated code makes it very difficult to do this. What I do for code reviews, is sit two developers down who have never even heard of the project at hand, and give them 10 minutes to understand what the code is doing.  If they cant figure out what its doing in a short period of time, the code fails. (Amongst other things we look for). But the idea is - Im happy that my guys can work up all sorts of fancy ways to do things, but we have to be able to pull and add resources quickly.	whozurdaddy	programming	10	10	0	2009-01	1233428499		c07e116	7tvkc

0	I disagree. I believe that basic computer science classes are essential, especially today. It should absolutely be a part of any modern science curriculum. Not only would it introduce many people to general, computer-related concepts (e.g. hierarchical file systems, which I swear people cannot understand) as well as being an initial introduction to computer languages and computing, presented primarily as a way to solve problems (rather than in the abstract). I find that studying computer science has given me better problem solving skills and has changed the way I approach many problems.	drewhenson	programming	2	2	0	2009-01	1233375483	The problem is not that CS is inaccessible, it's that it is not taught as a mandatory class in most middle schools and high schools.

It is not so much the melanin content of ones skin as it is the expansiveness of the consciousness and inner direction of the individual. Steele is a tool of a classic reactionary consciousness.

Check that the CPU fan is secure. When I had this problem I noticed the CPU fan had come slightly loose from the CPU. There should be a small amount of thermal grease between the fan and CPU as well. Since it had come loose, it wasn't being properly cooled. I purchased a new fan (the original one was garbage) along with a small tube of thermal grease. Once a new layer of grease was applied and the new fan was installed, that solved the problem for me.	c07disu	7tq4b

0	As a musician I totally get this, but I think you can take a different approach.  I find myself enjoy very small things in certain songs.  The timing of a snare right before the bridge, a three note riff gently played behind the pre-chorus.  Anyone can throw 4 chords together and make an allright song, but it's those little moments that are awesome.  The thing you didn't plan but heard a little harmony in your head that you felt you should include.  It feels like it didn't even happen, like it was somehow meant to be in that song and you just forgot to include it when you first wrote it.  Someone taps you on the shoulder and whispers, throw this in there.  So when I listen to music, I find myself noticing those moments, two seconds of sound that most listeners overlook, but I know that for a moment the writer had their concentration fixed on that tiny aspect and made the conscious choice to put it in.  I love how every beat and note are there for a reason, someone loved it, someone was excited when they listened back to it the first time.  I feel like I've grown to share that moment with the writer.	cedargrove	self	1	1	0	2009-01	1233353242		c07dihh	7thxr

But please could people be open minded to this question of mine. I'm not coming from the left or right, just take this as a question from someone entirely neutral, wondering how people feel about this. How is this any different from people buying the bus ads for atheism? You raise money for your view or your side of any argument. To ""promote"" or ""advertise"" your pov. You get the word out to people, good or bad, that's how it goes. The bus ads didn't even have a religious counter-ad plan to put other ads on other buses.(Please don't just resort to the fact that religion is everywhere this isn't really about that, I'm just using the example.) It just seems to me that people love democracy, and freedom of speech, as long as it's going their way. If not then it's a problem. This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, this is how all politics and a lot of things in America, and not just America, work. Money talks and in essence politics are for the most part ""bought"" if you want to call it that in this system. So what is the real problem here? How is this different? What should be changed?

0	I always leave a flat 15% barring exceptional circumstances. If the service, or the food, or the drinks, or the decor don't please me, I just don't go back. Tips do nothing for the quality of the food, or the drinks, or the decor, and I don't like acting as supervisor for the quality of how they bring the plate to my table. It's the supervisor's job to ensure that all staff treat customers well. The tips system sucks in my view, but since this is the way it works I just calculate the 15% premium and shut up about it until I can vent on the net.	see0red	atheism	2	2	0	2009-01	1233346383	If the wait staff were all salaried you would never get great service.  If I knew that I was getting the same tip regardless of the service, it would be average to poor every time.  I hope you don't frequent the same restaurant on a regular basis with this opinion.

0	I've often had something similar to that EHS happen, and have learned to recognize it as just another symptom of my chronic insomnia - it sounds like a very sharp, loud 'snap'.  It's not painful, but it's sort of a sound and sort of a feeling but really neither (I think that those are just the two senses that my conscious mind typically files it under, so to speak).  The best way I can describe it is, if you've had your wisdom teeth taken out and you did it without being put under general anesthesia (just numbed the mouth, instead), it's a lot like the feeling when the dentist pops the tooth out and you feel / hear a sharp 'crack' all up your jaw and skull, except here it seems to come from inside my head and not my actual skull.	oditogre	reddit.com	1	1	0	2009-01	1233344790		c07den6	7tjl2

The sheer audacity of it DEMANDED a snarky reply in which I pointed out that your own reply was a worse mockery of the language than what you felt so compelled to attack.

Some women will try and run up the bill to see if you're a) rich and/or b) the kind of push over willing to let it happen. You don't wanna be with these women anyways, so first thing you ask the server is to open up tabs (plural.) If she's drinking premium alcohol and ordering expensive dishes she's not eating, you know she's a fuck tard and you don't get stuck with the bill. If she turns out to be a good person, you can always ask the server to combine the bills and it was all a misunderstanding.	OriginalSyn	WTF	4	4	0	2009-01	1233342259		c07ddki	7tn0l

And typically immunity means you still testify, it's just that you won't be prosecuted as a result of your testimony given while under immunity. By not testifying first while still under immunity, Rove may have forfeited all immunity from that testimony so that once immunity is withdrawn all his testimony can be used against him.

0	The state I live in only finally approved the lotto when it was claimed that a large portion of the proceeds would go towards education. Never happened - the proceeds all go basically to a slush fund. If you want to be philanthropic, give to a good charity. If you want to gamble, buy tickets.	Clothos	AskReddit	2	2	0	2009-01	1233328516	Yes, statistically speaking it's absolutely ridiculous. I almost never buy tickets, but I will always defend them. There are two main strong arguments for buying a ticket. The first is, that it's a great way for Hospitals and other 'good for the community' projects to supplement their revenues (I understand that people might be cynical and feel that the money never goes to good projects, but the lottery commissions claim that it does). The second, is that there is much to the idea of the pleasure that you buy (for much less than a cup of coffee - and lasting for longer) for fantasizing about what you'll do with the winnings. This is a very unique and benign form of gambling addiction, in some ways. Since the likely-hood of winning is so astronomically tiny, you almost never ever hear of somebody 'lotto-ing' their life's savings away - as you do with more traditional gambling forms.	c07d802	7tjx9

The right attitude is to be very skeptical of all criminology and to be derisive towards new claims."	redditcensoredme	science	6	6	0	2009-01	1233320947	Lie detection based on physiological responses under uncontrolled conditions raises some flags in my mind, mostly because of how noisy the data can get.  The company mentioned came to the research lab I used to work for and made a presentation about their layered voice analysis (LVA) software.  From what I could tell, there was very little scientific background in their development.  In addition, they only had anecdotal evidence to support their claims about lie detection.  That was back in 2004, which should have been plenty of time for them to run good studies on LVA to know if in fact it works.  I am still very skeptical of their technology until I see some solid scientific evidence.	c07d5vi	7tiuk

BobbyKen	science	1	1	0	2009-01	1233314055	This is an AWFUL paper, clearly written to instill fear in a lay audience.  Aside from the quantity issue (clearly rebutted in the above two comments), the author does not make ANY distinction between di- and mono- methylmercury compounds (HIGHLY toxic) and inorganic mercury compounds (much less toxic).  Mercury found in HFCS is of the inorganic variety.  He does go on to site a bunch of studies reporting the dangers of methyl and dimethyl mercury.  This could not be any less relavent.  Booooooooo bad science.	c07d4q8	7ta0r

Me and the better part of the humanity hope that this will prove true at the super-national level; European Union, African Union, Asean or South American soludarity are more proofs than the UN that this makes sense.

If they spent their money and effort trying to send a message _peacefully_ to Americans (who are primarily responsible for this mess--our bombs, our funding, our necessary support) their message would be easily ignored by the people who have the power to spread it (mainstream news, US government, etc.).  Bombs, on the other hand, cannot be ignored so easily.  Thus, I cannot blame Hamas for trying to communicate in such a fashion.  It's not good, that's for sure.  I'd _prefer_ if their message could be delivered peacefully.  But _we_ have created an environment that _forces_ them to take violent actions.  It's unrealistic to expect them to change until _we_ change the environment _first_.	c07d3hu	7tj09

Bedrovelsen	reddit.com	3	3	0	2009-01	1233300250	I'm not sure which state you live in, but I have a conceal carry permit in Kansas. Here, we are not required by law to alert the police officer that we have a firearm in the car. However, if the officer asks us if there is a weapon in the car, we must legally admit it.  The officer is most likely incorrect in stating that you should have told him about the gun.  But then again, you most likely didn't even have to hand him your conceal carry permit either.  I have my permit separate from my drivers license for that very reason. People will only know I have a gun when I choose or am bound by law to tell them.	c07d2fc	7tj50

0	Those gas chambers were used for de-licing cloths and weren't engineered to kill humans. As far as numbers are concerned, the 6 million figure included the claim that 4.1 million died at Auschwitz camp. This claim of 4.1 million dead was posted on the gate until I think late 1980s. But this was later changed to 1.2 million. Yet the 6 million figure is still used. My point is, more research needs to be done and Holocaust should be based on scientific facts and not eyewitness testimony.	ThickGreenPuke	atheism	-1	-1	0	2009-01	1233288457		c07cz68	7tcm3

I have come to the conclusion it is simply a venting process for those who not only do not believe in GOD, but feel it is their duty to lash out at anyone who does, as if by doing so, they are making the world a better place.  I will never understand why an atheist takes it so personal that a person thanks GOD.  Who gives a shit?  Really, why does it bother you soooo much that a person mention GOD.  I get it, you disagree with that sentiment.  You find it almost repulsive that someone could believe in some kind of imaginary figure.  You are annoyed by how children are socialized into religion, without ever questioning it.  You are annoyed with how everyone looks to GOD for answers, when you, the wise atheist knows that GOD does not exist.  But from a practical standpoint, who really gives a shit.

0	Religion is very simple, theological training is redundant. The main flaw of religion is faith in supernatural things that don't matter. The Vedas, the Bible and all similar writings of men are irrelevant to this. Here's how it goes. Things that affect us can be studied because they affect us. We call them natural and we care about them. Things that don't affect us cannot be studied because they have no effect. We call them supernatural.

0	"You can never escape the reality of people buying what is cheaper, so you can't try to fight it from that end. I myself usually buy the cheaper option even if I am morally opposed to how it was produced, because I simply don't have enough extra cash at the moment to warrant the more expensive item. So the question isn't ""how do we change how people behave,"" but rather ""how do we make changes in other area so that there isn't a price difference between the two options, or even go so far as to make the better option also the most affordable one?"" If I'm standing in a car dealership and there's a hybrid for $25,000 and a non-hybrid for $18,000, and gas is still $2.00/gallon, I'm probably going to go for the non-hybrid. So how do we get the hybrid down to the same price point so that consumers don't have to take such a leap? One way is to give a tax break to a car company for each hybrid it sells, another way is to increase taxes on a company for each non-hybrid it sells (in accordance with its emissions and fuel consumption). The same can be applied to power generation. Tax CO2 and provide tax breaks to power companies who are below a set power-per-CO2 ratio. This will allow wind and solar power to flourish because coal will become economically nonviable. The consumer can't be expected to behave in any way other than in his own economic interest, so we need to concentrate effecting changes at the top levels, so that the consumer doesn't have to make that choice at all."	madmax_br5	environment	2	2	0	2009-01	1233269137	the problem is consumers don't connect the two. sometime in the future, there will be hell to pay. but for now, buying the least expensive items up front is most advantageous to many consumers.

0	No contest. Krugman's notion of a $1.50 return for every $1.00 spent by government is going out the window. He based this on the idea of increased tax revenue, but with a debate over using the money with foreign companies, his whole idea is shot to hell. This is a central idea to Keynesians and it doesn't appear to account for globalization.	aletoledo	business	0	0	0	2009-01	1233257325	Solutions: A Tag Team Cage match!

Uiaccsk	politics	7	7	0	2009-01	1233210210	One major upside of the coming New American Order will be the inevitable re-concentration of cities into more old-fashioned, multi-use hubs that work better than any urban renewal or suburbification schemes ever could. Manhattan will be the model, and if cities like Houston and LA don't adopt it, they'll wither away painfully. I predict that in 25 years, vast tracts of suburbia will be returning to forest, much as 19th-century Eastern-US farms did during the 20th century. And as long as Americans don't fight the coming changes too strenuously, things will improve, and they will come to be as relatively content as most Europeans are today.	c07cafd	7t80b

0	The stomach acid has already broken down the sucrose before it hits the small intestine.  Even if you were right about it breaking down more slowly that would make it more likely that fructose would make it to the large intestine.  The speed the material moves through the small intestine is the same in both cases.  If it is already broken up into monosaccharides that gives the intestine more time to absorb the fructose.  You should think first before repeating nonsense.	bCabulon	science	1	1	0	2009-01	1233203713	Well no, it's not the same at all.  The break down of sucrose in to glucose and fructose slows the absorption of fructose considerably allowing the small intestine more time to digest it. This greatly reduces the amount of excess fructose being passed along to the large intestine.	c07c8ib	7suqa

0	If you have ever worked with fruit fields you will realize that the fruit that is getting exported usually is picked early.  The fruit is less likely to rot by the time it reaches faraway markets, but with strawberries the delicate nature is also a factor.  You can use preservatives like fruit wax to slow the rotting of the fruit during transit, but strawberries like most berries are pretty delicate and become more delicate as time passes.  Therefore, the fruit that is closer to being fully ripe tends to get sold locally whereas the less ripe fruit is sold for export.	SAugsburger	science	1	1	0	2009-01	1233195794		c07c5x1	7t247
