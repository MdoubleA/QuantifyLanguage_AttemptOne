0	We do code reviews where I work because we work on critical systems. I find them to be very useful for catching bugs and also for creating a stylistically cohesive code base. It's nice to be able to have a discussion about coding practices with talented, open minded developers. The problems is however, getting teams of talented, open minded developers that work well together. Code reviews with a team that is friendly and gets along are great. Code reviews where there is tension on the team are absolutely horrendous. If you don't have mutual respect for one another, code reviews are incredibly painful. They really only work with either a really great team, or with clean room development where the people feeding back the comments are completely independent from the developers.

I would usually let them in because I felt bad, missionaries are basically just kids who don't really know any better.  I would let them in, give em some water and have some mild debates for my own amusement.  so that day, since my mind was still filled with my classes debate about piss christ i described the piece to them and asked them what they thought.  they shifted uncomfortably in their chairs, looked at each other at a loss of how to respond, when the older one looked at me, leaned over and said ""well sister, we know that you're a good person and we'll pray for you"".  they then hightailed it out of there, and my parents never sent missionaries my way again."	quitabandita	wikipedia	3	3	0	2009-01	1232310940	Piss Christ.	c074e3i	7qk4n

I had assumed that, despite increase in computer use, you would have to know fewer and fewer computer science details as time goes on, but this is not necessarily true. My advice: don't just learn things for their own sake. Be exacting. You can only learn so much in a day, so be picky and optimize your day to spend every minute learning only exactly what you specifically need to know. Learn as you work, whatever you need for the job at the time. There are no secret programming languages or hidden, advanced graphic design techniques.

The problem you imbecile is that I already know what that book will contain, superficial crap with superficial correlations. And I know all the loopholes and flaws in the book as well. And I know all this without wasting my time reading that pile of crap.	redditcensoredme	cogsci	1	1	0	2009-01	1232261763	"I'm not using ""emotion intelligence"" as a derogatory term.

My teacher was so fucking old and mean that he assigned us one-page *A Christmas Story*-style themes every week (this is an example of him being out-of-date, not mean; obviously it's an easy fucking assignment). They were worth ten points each. The first one I got back, graded, he had circled in red and deducted a point for *every time I used a semicolon.* I got a 4/10. So I quit the fucking class, took regular American History, got an easy A+ and still scored a 5 on the AP test.

In Israel Refuseniks are often declared mentally ill by the government to invalidate their criticism of Israeli governmental policy.	IrishJoe	worldpolitics	6	6	0	2009-01	1232242240		c073xao	7qgu1

0	I don't know much about pilates in general, but I  will tell you this.  Correcting your posture and becoming flexible will be one of the best choices of your life.  It will change the way you feel each day.  You'll feel younger, stronger, and have so much more energy.  I can't begin to describe how improving my posture has changed my life.  Try the pilates, if you don't like it try yoga.  If anything, just stretch at home while you're watching tv or sitting in a chair.  It becomes addicting, and I guarantee the first time you feel a knot come out through stretching you'll make it your goal to get them all.  A great natural high and it dramatically improves your breathing.  Do it.  Doooo it.	cedargrove	Health	4	4	0	2009-01	1232237777	Pilates - can it correct a lifetime of poor posture?

0	"The vast majority of people (both Jewish and non-Jewish) who want the Israeli government to stop the slaughter of Palestinian civilians do *NOT* I repeat *NOT* want the destruction of Israel. They simply want Israeli policies toward Palestinians to change. There are probably some who may hold this point of view (desiring to destroy Israel), but they are in the vast minority. Unfortunately, the equating of opposition to slaughter of civilians with a desire to destroy Israel is a ploy used by many who support these policies to try to thwart any rational discussion of Israeli policy. I'm sorry if you've had bad experiences with discussions of Israeli policy toward the killing of Palestinian civilians. Passions run high when people are dying, but calling for ""an eye for an eye"" vengeance against Israeli civilians is not right either. I'm afraid I will have to vote your post down for conflating opposition to bad policies (which will hurt both the US and Israel in the long run) with antisemitism or a desire to destroy Israel.

0	Yeah, I used melted butter in mine. If I make some bacon, I might try a batch with bacon fat?  I'll try baking powder and soda next time. I'll get some brown sugar too, maybe even some molasses.	Ra__	reddit.com	1	1	0	2009-01	1232233828	You've got the basic recipe there already, and that's all cornbread is. It's very basic. Southern style is generally not sweet at all, although a bit of brown sugar (1/4 C. or less) isn't unheard of. Mmmm, brown sugar. Very molasses, very southern. Also, you might try tossing in a teaspoon or 2 of baking powder along with just a dash of baking soda to give this no-yeast recipe a little rise as it cooks. My momma (we're talking southern here, it has to be momma!) would grease the pan with shortening, but the mix itself was always with butter, not oil or shortening. I don't know that that's tradition, but it's how I always had it growing up.	c073unt	7qggb
0	Wait, you're saying he had no power steering? I call bullshit.	markitymark	reddit.com	3	3	0	2009-01	1232233822	Well yes, I may be able to help you.  APU (Aux Power Unit) disengaged after take off and both engines down would not be engaged due to possibility of dumping fluid or igniting fuel.  This means that the pilot had no power to any critical systems and was in 'boost out' conditions.  He had to land this puppy on cables which is very hard to do and is last resort to TRY to save anyone.  It is equivalent to your car engine dying, losing power steering, and a deer just jumped on the road in front of you.  The fact that this guy got such angle and levelness of the wings as to not have a roll is a feat that deserves a great amount of respect for his skill and execution of such under great pressure.	c073unr	7qh99
0	So it doesn't matter how many people, or who within a party votes, as long as someone does you deem it to be a democratic process, yet you dismiss the fact that a democratic process was involved in electing Hamas in the national arena.

My point is that the process a party uses for its internal structure has no bearing on whether the political system it operates within is democratic or not.	ajehals	WTF	2	2	0	2009-01	1232233705		c073umq	7qfgd

The point of these institutions (and non-profits in general) is to contribute to the community in a positive manner.  And for the most part, this is exactly what happens.  Whatever you might say about the ""misguided"" beliefs of Christianity or any other religion, many of their their followers truly try to help people out.  Of course, we always hear about abuse of charities, etc. on the news, but the only reason it's news is that such occurrences are relatively rare.  When such abuse does happen, one has the recourse of the judicial system.  The reason the Church of Scientology needs tax-exempt status revoked is that there is absolutely no good this so-called Church gets up to.

0	I think the biggest problem with the Discovery Institute is that supposedly in order to work there you must agree to not do any research to debunk ID Theory.  The moment you say that you are disregarding a possibility entirely you are engaged in the process of searching for evidence to confirm your biases.	SAugsburger	science	3	3	0	2009-01	1232226970	"Yes, I am very familiar with the Discovery Institute and their secret documents exposed for trying to destroy the theory of evolution. I am aware of Berkley Law Professor Phillip Johnson, one of the ""founders"" of Intelligent Design. I am aware of Michael Behe, his teaching at Lehigh University, his writings on Intelligent Design (Darwin's Black Box, The Edge of Evolution), and his inability to defend Intelligent Design when it was on trial. I am aware of, ""Of Pandas and People,"" the first Intelligent Design textbook that was simply a creationist textbook in which they simply changed, ""creationism"" to ""intelligent design"". The fact is, Intelligent Design is pseudoscience that was debunked the minute the bacterial flagellum was exposed as most likely having evolved to its present state. If it wasn't for the uncovering of ""Of Pandas.."" and the secret documents from the Discovery Institute revealing their true motives in the name of religion, and that law professors backing ID not because its an acceptable scientific theory but because its there chance to take part ""in the great legal fight"" that has dated back to the Scopes-Monkey Trial of 1925, then just maybe Intelligent Design could be taken a little bit more seriously. In reality, as mentioned but other posters, Intelligent Design is a masking agent for ""Creationism"" in an attempt to have it instilled into the public school systems. It's a pseudoscience, and as many studies (Miller, Scott, et al. 2006) have shown, the lesser intelligence you have the more likely you are not to accept the theories of evolution."	c073se0	7qf22

0	That is assuming that the bible is legitimate. Back when I was a christian (I know, boo, hiss, yadda yadda) The biggest problem I had was that it was like god had a split personality, and the first step towards becoming an atheist was realizing that the bible is pretty much a lie. People would do horrible shit and then legitimize it in history by claiming god led them to do it, and that history became the old testament. So the people who were killing homosexuals were just douche bags who got out of trouble using religion.	bechus	atheism	4	4	0	2009-01	1232215938		c073ood	7qgg2

Many of them grow up pretty isolated from the rest of society, only really interacting with other mennonites. You guys are calling this guy dumb, but knowing the situation I'd have to say that this guy *honestly* didn't know, and most of his friends and family didn't either.

0	I've been coping with panic disorder for the last year or so. I can't really post any helpful techniques that haven't already been posted (focusing on my breathing and marijuana if I'm home alone help me the most). Don't worry about it too much, the first attack is the worst one. You don't feel any less fear in later attacks, but the main thing is you will become used to the altered state of mind. Realizing that you are not going to die, not harm will come of it is the most helpful thing to think about. If it becomes a real problem I recommend seeing a counselor or a psychiatrist. I've been on anti-depressants in the past; they help a lot but the side effects just aren't worth it. If you are considering a medication I highly recommend marijuana.	moozilla	AskReddit	1	1	0	2009-01	1232178693		c073h74	7qct7

(FYI there are literally hundreds and hundreds of other municipalities in Canada, and the overlapping interest in toronto transit outside of toronto is limited to a few expats away at university or starting a life in vancouver/ottawa/montreal/etc. why wouldn't those expats join the toronto subreddit?)	c073g1j	7q86c

0	Karl Rove is an opportunist.  His faith lies not in a being but rather in an ability to formulate a set of images that resonate with a critical mass of individuals in an electorate.   My brand of atheism dismisses that an being is responsible for all that is.  That orientation does not dismiss the possibility that the cosmos is filled with a fractional capacity that is intelligent down to particle (or smaller) level.  That orientation does not, however, allow for any evil to be committed for an outcome.  I leave that to Karl Rove.	LanternBearer	atheism	2	2	0	2009-01	1232164229	Karl Rove Is An Atheist	c073dr0	7qd2c

0	I do it only when I'm around people I know I won't offend.  This was because of the first time I actually debated somone.  It was a while back with one of my colleagues who is severely devout (he even listens to non-church Christian music).  One day at work, actually at lunch in the cafeteria, we were talking about religion and I was arguing against Chrisitanity.  It was quiet and fun, but since we were in a public place (a childrens hospital no less), I became uncomfortable speaking so open mindedly about it.  It was more or less the parents of the sicks kids arounds us which made me feel like I could be taking something away from them, especially the religious ones.  My colleague, who's a physician, didn't seem to mind though, but then gave me a long boring talk about self esteem and why I shouldn't care what other people think about me on the way back to the lab.

Good parents know that legal prostitution is way worse then the subtle prostitution our society tolerates. She should go to a club with a $15 cover, so only rich guys with spiked hair get in, and make a guy buy her tons of drinks, showing how much money he has, then to top it off, take her back to her apartment so she can see how big it is(the apartment, not the other thing). That's a good, Christian way of doing it. These whores who are honest and straight forward with their sexuality have no place in American society.	c072yw2	7p7dm

No, I won't sit back and wait 2 or 3 months with no reportage of what's going on there. That's what is truly irresponsible. There was a war going on in Rwanda and the world sat back and waited for it to be over. When it was over we learned that between 800,000 and 1,000,000 people (almost all civilians) had been killed. Wait 2 or 3 months to see what's going on in there? No, you couldn't even wait that long because you showed me a video of Palestinians using an ambulance as a troop carrier. You made my point.

He could not even imagine colour.  He understood the abstract concept, but he could no more summon the perception of ""red"" than you or I can imagine what ""strangeness"" or ""topness"" looks like as applied to quarks.

This chick might be that...god I hate the term, but computer illiterate. Now, because this is linux, she can't even get online to research her questions. Even if she could, I am sure more than a few of us have dealt with these kinds of people before - they don't even not how to phrase a question with the right computer jargon to be able to help them. Windows pretty much works right out of the box. You want to install something? Click setup.exe and it ends up being right there in your start menu, no problem. In linux, you first have to setup repositories, then search for a program you might not even know the name of, then install something that is not the familiar EXE, then it hardly ever appears in your start menu, so you have to go search for it in /usr or /usr/bin , I mean come on, can you blame your poor grandmother for not knowing how to do any of this when she can't even figure out how to setup her network?

I was merely pointing out that I find it sad that in the US law enforcement tends to view the sex slaves as criminals for participating in illegal prostitution when in fact many were held against their will forced to be where they are (even imported). The ""patrons"" of such services are often let go and not viewed criminally."	potatogun	politics	1	1	0	2009-01	1232086584	"I think the downmods come from the tendency of some of the more hyperbolic commentators on human trafficking to conflate sex tourism/use of services of a sexual nature, slavery and paedophilia.  In your own post you made a statement which is either a meaningless truism or does just this.  You say ""often view subjugated women who are sex slaves as criminals, when most of them are held against their will by their owners.""  Either you mean sex slaves are mostly held against their will - which is an understated truism, since all sex slaves are by definition held against their will, or you mean most sex workers are held against their will, which is a hyperbolic assertion unsupported by mainstream evidence."	c072nh1	7pwv0
